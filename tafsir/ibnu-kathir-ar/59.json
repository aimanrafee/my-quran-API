            "text": "<h2>Which was revealed in Al-Madinah</h2><p>Ibn `Abbas used to call this chapter, `Surah Bani An-Nadir.' Sa`id bin Mansur recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"I asked Ibn `Abbas about Surat Al-Hashr and he said, `It was revealed about Bani An-Nadir.\"' Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded it using another chain of narration from Ibn `Abbas. Al-Bukhari also recorded it from Abu `Awanah, from Abu Bishr from Sa`id bin Jubayr, who said, \"I asked Ibn `Abbas, `Surat Al-Hashr' He said, `Surah Bani An-Nadir.\"'</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Everything glorifies Allah in its own Way</h2><p>Allah states that everything that exists in the heavens and on the earth praises, glorifies, reveres and prays to Him and affirms His Oneness. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ السَّمَـوَتُ السَّبْعُ وَالاٌّرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ وَإِن مِّن شَىْءٍ إِلاَّ يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدَهِ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تَفْقَهُونَ تَسْبِيحَهُمْ</p><p>(The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise. But you understand not their glorification.)(17:44) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ</p><p>(And He is the Almighty) meaning of invincible majesty,</p><p>الْحَكِيمُ</p><p>(the All-Wise.) in what He decrees and legislates.</p><h2>The End that Bani An-Nadir suffered</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى أَخْرَجَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(He it is Who drove out the disbelievers among the People of the Scripture) referring to the Jewish tribe of Bani An-Nadir, according to Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Az-Zuhri and several others. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ migrated to Al-Madinah, he made a peace treaty with the Jews stipulating that he would not fight them and they would not fight him. They soon betrayed the treaty that they made with Allah's Messenger ﷺ. Therefore, Allah sent His torment down on them; it can never be averted, and His appointed destiny touched them; it can never be resisted. The Prophet forced them to evacuate and abandon their fortified forts that Muslims did not think they would ever control. The Jews thought that their fortifications will save them from Allah's torment, but they did not help them against Allah in the least. Then, that which they did not expect came to them from Allah, and Allah's Messenger ﷺ forced them to leave Al-Madinah. Some of them went to Adhri`at in the area of Ash-Sham, which is the area of the grand Gathering and Resurrection, while others went to Khaybar. The Prophet allowed them to evacuate their forts and take whatever their camels could carry. They destroyed the property that they could not carry. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>يُخْرِبُونَ بُيُوتَهُمْ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَيْدِى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ فَاعْتَبِرُواْ يأُوْلِى الاٌّبْصَـرِ</p><p>(they demolished their own dwellings with their own hands and the hands of the believers Then take admonition, O you with eyes.) meaning, \"Contemplate the end of those who defied Allah's command, contradicted His Messenger and denied His Book. See how Allah's humiliating torment struck them in this life, as well as, the painful torment that Allah has reserved for them in the Hereafter.\" Abu Dawud recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin Ka`b bin Malik said that one of the Prophet's Companions said, \"The Quraysh idolators wrote to `Abdullah bin Ubayy and those who were still worshipping idols among the tribes of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was in Al-Madinah at the time, before the battle of Badr occurred. They wrote: `You have given refuge to our citizen. We swear by Allah, you should fight him, or we will expel you or gather all our forces, until we kill your soldiers and take your women captive.' When the news of this threat reached `Abdullah bin Ubayy and the idolators of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj, they prepared to fight the Prophet . The news of this reached the Prophet and he went to them saying,</p><p>«لَقَدْ بَلَغَ وَعِيدُ قُرَيْشٍ مِنْكُمُ الْمَبَالِغَ، مَا كَانَتْ تَكِيدُكُمْ بِأَكْثَرَ مِمَّا تُرِيدُ أَن تَكِيدُوا بِهِ أَنْفُسَكُمْ، تُرِيدُونَ أَنْ تُقَاتِلُوا أَبْنَاءَكُمْ وَإِخْوَانَكُم»</p><p>(The threat of the Quraysh has caused you extreme anxiety! The Quraysh cannot cause you more harm than what you will cause yourselves by your actions. Do you want to fight your children and brethren) When they heard these words from the Prophet , they dis- persed and the news of what happened reached the Quraysh idolators. After the battle of Badr, the Quraysh idolators wrote to the Jews of Al-Madinah, `You have armor and forts! You should fight our citizen or we will do such and such to you, and nothing will prevent us from acquiring your women.'The news of this letter also reached the Prophet and Bani An-Nadir intended to betray their treaty. Bani An-Nadir sent a message to the Prophet asking him to come with thirty of his Companions to meet thirty of their rabbis half way, from either side. They said that the rabbis would listen to the Prophet and if they believe in him, the rest of Bani An-Nadir would believe. They intended to kill the Messenger , and Allah informed His Messenger of this plot before they could harm him. The next day, the Prophet gathered his forces and laid siege to their area, saying to them,</p><p>«إِنَّكُمْ وَاللهِ لَا تَأْمَنُونَ عِنْدِي إِلَّا بِعَهْدٍ تُعَاهِدُونَنِي عَلَيْه»</p><p>(By Allah ! You will not be safe until and unless you renew your peace treaty with me.) They refused to do so, and the Prophet fought them the rest of that day. The next morning, the Prophet laid siege to the tribe of Bani Qurayzah and left Bani An-Nadir alone that day. The Prophet ordered Bani Qurayzah to sign a new treaty of peace, and they accepted. The Prophet left Bani Qurayzah and went back to Bani An-Nadir with his forces and fought them until they agreed to surrender in return for safe passage out of Al-Madinah. Bani An-Nadir evacuated Al-Madinah and took with them all whatever their camels could carry from their furniture, including even the wood and the doors to their houses. The date trees of Bani An-Nadir were granted to the Messenger by Allah when He said,</p><p>وَمَآ أَفَآءَ اللَّهُ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ مِنْهُمْ فَمَآ أَوْجَفْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ خَيْلٍ وَلاَ رِكَابٍ</p><p>(And what Allah gave as booty to His Messenger from them -- for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry) that is, what you earned without a fight. The Prophet divided most of their trees between the emigrants and gave to only two men who were poor from Al-Ansar. He did not give the Ansar any of it, except for these two men. The Prophet kept a part of the war booty for himself and that part of charity of the Prophet was transferred to the administration of his daughter's children, i.e., children of Fatimah.\" However, let us summarize the battle of Bani An-Nadir here. From Allah alone we seek help.</p><h2>The Reason behind the Battle of Bani An-Nadir</h2><p>After the seventy Companions whom the Prophet sent to teach the Qur'an were killed at the area of Bi'r Ma`unah, excluding `Amr bin Umayyah Ad-Damri, who killed two men from the tribe of Bani `Amir on his way back to Al-Madinah. He did not know that these two men had a promise of safe passage from Allah's Messenger ﷺ. When he went back to Al-Madinah, he told the Prophet what happened and the Prophet said,</p><p>«لَقَدْ قَتَلْتَ رَجُلَيْنِ لَأَدِيَنَّهُمَا»</p><p>(You have killed two men, I shall pay the blood money for them.) Bani An-Nadir and Bani `Amir were allies and had treaties. The Prophet asked Bani An-Nadir to help pay the blood money for the two dead men. The area of Bani An-Nadir was in a suburb of Al-Madinah, a few miles to the east. In his book of Sirah, Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said; \"Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ went to Bani An-Nadir to ask them for financial help to pay the blood money of the two men from Bani `Amir, who were killed by `Amr bin Umayyah Ad-Damri. They had a promise of safe passage from the Prophet according to the (subnarrator) Yazid bin Ruman. Bani An-Nadir and Bani `Amir had a treaty and were allies. When Allah's Messenger ﷺ went to Bani An-Nadir asking them for help to pay the blood money for the two men, they said, `Yes, O Abu Al-Qasim! We will help you, since you asked us for help.' Yet, when they met each other in secret, they said, `You will not find a better chance with this man than this,' while the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sitting next to a wall of one of their houses. They said, `Who will ascend this wall and drop a stone on this man and rid us of his trouble' `Amr bin Jihash bin Ka`b volunteered and ascended the wall of the house to drop a stone on the Messenger . The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sitting with several of his Companions, such as Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Ali. The news of this plot was conveyed to the Prophet from heaven, and he stood up and went back to Al-Madinah. When the Companions thought that the Messenger was absent for a long time, they went to see where he was and saw a man coming from Al-Madinah. They asked him, and he said that he saw the Prophet enter Al-Madinah. The Messenger's Companions went to him, and he told them the news of the betraying plot that the Jews planned against him. He ordered them to prepare for war and to march forth to Bani An-Nadir. The Prophet gathered his forces and marched to the area of Bani An-Nadir, who had taken refuge in their fortified forts. The Messenger ﷺ ordered their date trees be cut down and burned. The Jews heralded at the Prophet, `O Muhammad! You used to forbid mischief in the earth and blame those who did it. Why is it that you had the date trees cut down and burned' Meanwhile, `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul, Wadi`ah, Malik bin Abi Qawqal, Suwayd, Da`is and several other men who all belonged to the tribe of Al-Khazraj bin Bani `Awf, sent a message to Bani An-Nadir saying, `Be firm and strong. We will never abandon you. If you are fought against, we will fight along with you and if you are forced to leave Al-Madinah, we will accompany you.' The Jews waited for this claim of support, but the hypocrites did not deliver. Allah cast terror in the hearts of the Jews. They asked the Messenger to allow them safe passage out of Al-Madinah and to spare their lives. In return, they would only take what their camels could carry, except for weapons. The Prophet agreed. The Jews collected all the wealth their camels could transport. One of the Jews would demolish his own house around its door, so that he could carry the door on the back of his camel. Bani An-Nadir moved to Khaybar, and some of them went to Ash-Sham. They left all that remained behind for the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who had control over how it was to be divided. The Prophet divided it between the emigrants and none of Al-Ansar got a share, except for Sahl bin Hunayf and Abu Dujanah Simak bin Kharashah. They said that they were poor and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave them their share. Only two men from Bani An-Nadir embraced Islam, Yamin bin Umayr bin Ka`b bin `Amr bin Jihash and Abu Sa`d bin Wahb and they saved their wealth due to their acceptance of Islam.\" Ibn Ishaq continued, \"Some of the offspring of Yamin narrated to me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Yamin,</p><p>«أَلَمْ تَرَ مَا لَقِيتُ مِنَ ابْنِ عَمِّكَ وَمَا هَمَّ بِهِ مِنْ شَأْنِي؟»</p><p>(Have you not heard what your cousin plotted to do against me) Yamin bin `Umayr promised someone a reward if he killed his cousin `Amr bin Jihash, and someone killed him, according to their claim\" Ibn Ishaq then said, \"All of Surat Al-Hashr was revealed about Bani An-Nadir. \" A similar story was recorded by Yunus bin Bukayr from Ibn Ishaq. Allah's statement,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى أَخْرَجَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(He it is Who drove out the disbelievers among the People of the Scripture) refers to Bani An-Nadir,</p><p>مِن دِيَـرِهِمْ لاًّوَّلِ الْحَشْرِ</p><p>(from their homes at the first gathering.) Allah said,</p><p>مَا ظَنَنتُمْ أَن يَخْرُجُواْ</p><p>(You did not think that they would get out.) i.e., within the few days you laid siege against them. The Companions had surrounded their forts for only six days, and their forts were fortified and formidable. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُمْ مَّانِعَتُهُمْ حُصُونُهُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ فَأَتَـهُمُ اللَّهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَمْ يَحْتَسِبُواْ</p><p>(And they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But Allah reached them from a place where they expected it not.) meaning, there came to them from Allah what they did not expect or anticipate. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>قَدْ مَكَرَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ فَأَتَى اللَّهُ بُنْيَـنَهُمْ مِّنَ الْقَوَاعِدِ فَخَرَّ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّقْفُ مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَأَتَـهُمُ الْعَذَابُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(Those before them indeed plotted, but Allah struck at the foundation of their building, and then the roof fell down upon them, from above them, and the torment overtook them from directions they did not perceive.)(16:26) Allah said,</p><p>وَقَذَفَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ الرُّعْبَ</p><p>(and He cast terror into their hearts) means, Allah cast fear, terror and fright in their hearts, and why would that not happen to them He who was given victory, by Allah frightening his enemies the distance of a month, laid siege to them. May Allah's peace and blessings be on the Prophet. As in Ibn Ishaq's explanation -- which preceded;</p><p>يُخْرِبُونَ بُيُوتَهُمْ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَيْدِى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(that they demolished their own dwellings with their own hands and the hands of the believers.) the Jews brought down what they wanted to transport from their roofs and doors, so that they could carry them on camels. Similar was said by `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and several others. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَوْلاَ أَن كَتَبَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْجَلاَءَ لَعَذَّبَهُمْ فِى الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(And had it not been that Allah had decreed exile for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world;) meaning, if it was not for the fact that Allah had already decreed that they would evacuate Al-Madinah, leaving behind their homes and wealth, He would have sent another type of punishment upon them, such as being killed and captured. This was said by Az-Zuhri. `Urwah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said that Allah decreed that the Jews would be punished in the life of this world and face the torment of the fire of Hell He prepared for them in the Hereafter. Allah said,</p><p>وَلَهُمْ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ عَذَابُ النَّارِ</p><p>(and in the Hereafter theirs shall be the torment of the Fire.) meaning, it is a matter ordained that they will surely face,</p><p>ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ شَآقُّواْ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ</p><p>(That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger.) means, Allah prepared this specific punishment and sent His Messenger and his Companions against them, because they defied Allah and His Messenger and denied the good news that Allah sent forth in the Books of previous Messengers regarding the coming of Muhammad ﷺ. The Jews knew these facts about Muhammad ﷺ just as they knew their own children. Allah said,</p><p>وَمَن يُشَآقِّ اللَّهَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</p><p>(And whosoever opposes Allah, then verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.)</p><h2>The Prophet Cut down the Date Trees of the Jews by the Leave of Allah</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>مَا قَطَعْتُمْ مِّن لِّينَةٍ أَوْ تَرَكْتُمُوهَا قَآئِمَةً عَلَى أُصُولِهَا فَبِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَلِيُخْزِىَ الْفَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.) Linah is an especially good type of date tree. Abu `Ubaydah said that Linah is a different kind of dates than `Ajwah and Barni. Several others said that Linah refers to every type of date fruits, except for the `Ajwah (ripen dates), while Ibn Jarir said that it refers to all kinds of date trees. Ibn Jarir quoted Mujahid saying that it also includes the Buwayrah type. When the Messenger of Allah laid siege to Bani An-Nadir, to humiliate them and bring fear and terror to their hearts, he ordered their date trees to be cut down. Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated that Yazid bin Ruman, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan said, \"Bani An-Nadir sent a message to the Messenger , saying that he used to outlaw mischief in the earth, so why did he order that their trees be cut down Allah sent down this honorable Ayah stating that whatever Linah was felled or left intact by the Muslims, has been done by His permission, will, leave and pleasure to humiliate and disgrace the enemy and degrade them.\" Mujahid said, \"Some of the emigrants discouraged others from chopping down the date trees of Jews, saying that they were war spoils for Muslims. The Qur'an approved of the actions of those who discouraged and those who approved of cutting these trees, stating that those who cut them or did not, did so only by Allah's leave.\" There is also a Hadith narrated from the Prophet with this meaning. An-Nasa'i recorded that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement,</p><p>مَا قَطَعْتُمْ مِّن لِّينَةٍ أَوْ تَرَكْتُمُوهَا قَآئِمَةً عَلَى أُصُولِهَا فَبِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَلِيُخْزِىَ الْفَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.) \"They forced them to come down from their forts and were ordered to cut their trees cut down. So the Muslims hesitated, and some of them said, `We cut down some and left some. We must ask Allah's Messenger ﷺ if we will earn a reward for what we cut and if we will be burdened for what we left intact.' Allah sent down this Ayah, t</p><p>مَا قَطَعْتُمْ مِّن لِّينَةٍ أَوْ تَرَكْتُمُوهَا قَآئِمَةً عَلَى أُصُولِهَا فَبِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah).\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered that the date trees of Bani An-Nadir be cut down and burned. The Two Sahihs collected a similar narration. Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said,\"Bani An-Nadir and Bani Qurayzah fought (against the Prophet ), and the Prophet exiled Bani An-Nadir and allowed Bani Qurayzah to remain in their area until later, when the Prophet fought against Qurayzah. Their men were executed and their women, children and wealth were confiscated and divided among Muslims. Some of them, however, were saved because they returned to the Prophet's side, who granted them asylum, and they embraced Islam. All of the Jews of Al-Madinah, Bani Qaynuqa`, the tribe of `Abdullah bin Salam, Bani Harithah and the rest of the Jewish tribes in Al-Madinah were exiled.\" The Two Sahihs also recorded from Ibn `Umar that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ burned down the date trees of Bani An-Nadir and had them cut down the date palms of Al-Buwayrah. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored revealed this Ayah,</p><p>مَا قَطَعْتُمْ مِّن لِّينَةٍ أَوْ تَرَكْتُمُوهَا قَآئِمَةً عَلَى أُصُولِهَا فَبِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَلِيُخْزِىَ الْفَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.)\" Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that the battle of Bani An-Nadir occurred after the battles of Uhud and Bi'r Ma`unah.</p>"

Среди Его прекрасных имен - Могущественный, Мудрый. Все сущее подчинено Его власти, и для Него нет ничего трудного и невозможного. Его творения и повеления преисполнены мудрости, поскольку Он ничего не творит ради забавы, ниспосылает только полезные предписания и вершит только то, чего требует Его божественная мудрость. Эта сура также получила название «Бану Надыр». Так называлось крупное иудейское племя, жившее недалеко от Медины задолго до того, как Пророк Мухаммад, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, начал свою пророческую миссию. Когда же он переселился в Медину, то это племя, как и многие другие иудейские племена, отказалось уверовать в Единого Аллаха и Его посланника, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует. Тогда он заключил мирный договор с иудеями, которые были соседями мусульман в Медине. Спустя шесть месяцев после битвы при Бадре Пророк приехал в поселения племени Надыр и попросил их помочь мусульманам заплатить выкуп за Амра б. Умейу ад-Дамри, который убил нескольких людей из племени аль-Киляб. Иудеи сказали: «Мы поможем вам, Абу аль-Касым. Посиди здесь, пока мы не решим твой вопрос». Когда же они уединились для совместного принятия решения, сатана подтолкнул их на тяжкое преступление, дабы обрушить на них предписанное им несчастье. Они сговорились убить Пророка и сказали: «Кто возьмет этот камень и сбросит ее так, чтобы разбить ему голову?» Несчастный грешник по имени Амр б. Джуххаш вызвался на это дело. Тогда Салам б. Мишкам сказал: «Не делайте этого. Клянусь Аллахом, его оповестят о вашем заговоре, и тогда мы первыми разорвем заключенный с ним договор». Господь тотчас ниспослал Пророку, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, откровение о планах иудеев. Посланник Аллаха, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, встал и спешно отправился в Медину. Сподвижники догнали его и сказали: «Ты встал так, что мы даже не заметили этого». Он поведал им о заговоре иудеев, а затем отправил к ним послание со следующим повелением: «Покиньте Медину и никогда более не поселяйтесь в ней. Я даю вам десять дней, и если обнаружу вас здесь по истечении этого срока, то отрублю вам головы». В течение нескольких дней иудеи готовились к переселению. Но затем один из лицемеров по имени Абдуллах б. Убей б. Салул отправил им письмо, в котором написал: «Не покидайте своих домов. У меня есть две тысячи человек, которые готовы укрыться в вашей крепости и умереть за вас. Племя Курейза и ваши союзники из племени Гатфан также готовы помочь вам». Старейшина племени Надыр Хуай б. Ахтаб понадеялся на обещанную ему поддержку и написал посланнику Аллаха, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, следующее послание: «Мы не оставим своих домов, посему делай все, что тебе вздумается». Услышав об этом, посланник Аллаха возвеличил Аллаха, а его сподвижники тотчас приготовились к сражению. Знамя мусульман понес Али б. Абу Талиб. Иудеи обосновались в своих крепостях, отбиваясь камнями и стрелами. Курейзиты, сторонники Абдуллаха б. Убейа и союзники из Гатфана предательски отвернулись от них. Посланник Аллаха, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, окружил поселения иудеев и приказал своим сподвижникам начать вырубать и сжигать их пальмовые деревья. Осознав, в каком положении они оказались, иудеи написали Пророку, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, послание, в котором согласились покинуть Медину. Пророк, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, снял блокаду и позволил им собраться и уехать вместе со своими семьями и всем, что смогут унести их верблюды, кроме оружия. Так он овладел имуществом и оружием иудеев. Трофеи целиком достались Пророку, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, и были предназначены для нужд мусульман. Пророк, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, не стал делить военную добычу на пять частей, как это полагается делать с трофеями, потому что Аллах даровал ему эту добычу без борьбы. Мусульмане не седлали своих лошадей и не прилагали усилий для достижения победы. Пророк, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, изгнал иудеев в Хейбар вместе с их предводителем Хуайем б. Ахтабом. А мусульмане овладели их землями, жилищами и оружием. Среди трофеев оказалось пятьдесят кольчуг, пятьдесят шлемов и триста сорок мечей. Таково краткое описание событий, упомянутых в этой суре."

The present Surah describes the punishment faced by the Jews in this world in the form of exile and in the Hereafter in the form of grievous torment.</p><p>Cause of Revelation</p><p>The story of their banishment from Madinah is that when the Messeger of Allah ﷺ migrated to Madinah, he concluded a peace treaty with the Jews. Banu Nadir, one of the Jew tribes living around Madinah, were one of the three signatories. The latter tribe lived about two miles away from Madinah. Once it happened that ` Amr Ibn 'Umayyah Damuri killed two persons by mistake. According to Law, the Muslims jointly had to settle the blood-wit. The Holy Prophet ﷺ first collected money from the Muslims for this purpose. Then he decided to collect money from the Jews as well in terms of the treaty he already had with them. The Holy Prophet ﷺ visited the tribe of Banu Nadir for this purpose. Before his arrival, they conspired to put an end to his life. When he reached there, they made him sit against a wall and said to him that they were going to gather the blood money. In the meanwhile, they secretly plotted that someone should climb the particular wall in the shade of which the Holy Prophet ﷺ was sitting and drop a rock on him and kill him. But before the Jews could execute their sinister plan, Allah revealed to him in time about their plot and conspiracy. The Holy Prophet ﷺ instantly left the place, returned to Madinah and sent a message to Banu Nadir that they have betrayed the treaty. Therefore, they are given ten days in which to leave the town and go into exile, and were warned that if they would not meet the deadline, they might be killed at sight. They decided to leave, but ` Abdullah Ibn 'Ubayy prevented them. He said that they did not have to leave because he had an army of two thousand men who were willing to lay down their lives to protect the Jewish lives. It is stated in Ruh-ul-Ma` ani on the authority of Ibn Ishaq that along with ` Abdullah were Wadi'ah Ibn Malik, Suwaid and Ra'ish. The Jews fell into the trap of the three and sent a message to the Holy Prophet that they would not leave. As a result, he together with the noble Companions ؓ marched on that tribe. The Jews locked themselves up in the fortresses, but the hypocrites, being essentially cowards, hid themselves. The Holy Prophet ﷺ laid a siege to the Jewish fortresses. Some of their date palms were felled and others were burnt down. Eventually, they agreed to go into exile. So, the Holy Prophet ﷺ forced them to evacuate and abandon their fortresses and, in kindness, allowed to take with them enough provisions, whatever their cavalry and camelry could carry except arms and weapons, which, they were told, would be confiscated. Some of them went to Syria, while others went to Khaibar. On account of their greed, they carried with them even beams, rafters, woods and the doors of their houses. This incident took place after the battle of Badr in RabI'-ul Awwal 4 AH. Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ ، during his caliphate, sent them away to Syria to live with the rest of the Jews. The two banishments go under the names of the 'first banishment' and the 'second banishment'. [ Zad-ul-Ma’ ad ].</p><p>The Characteristics of Surah AI-Hashr and the History of Banu Nadir</p><p>The entire Surah Al-Hashr was revealed in connection with Bani Nadir [ Ibn Ishaq ]. Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ used to call this Surah, Surah Banff Nadir. [ Ibn Kathir ]. Bani Nadir were the descendents of the Holy Prophet Harun ﷺ . Their forefathers were scholars of Torah, which contained a full description of the Last Prophet ﷺ such as his physical features, his signs of Prophet-hood and his migration to Yathrib (Madinah). This tribe was under the impression that the Last Prophet ﷺ would be one of the descendents of Holy Prophet Harun (علیہ السلام) and they would have the pleasure of being in his company. For this reason, they migrated from Syria and settled in Yathrib. Some of the contemporaries of the Holy Prophet ﷺ were also scholars of the Torah, who saw his physical features and other signs of Prophet-hood and recognized him as the Final Messenger but, as they thought that he would be one of the descendents of Harun they were disappointed when he was raised among the descendents of Ismail (علیہ السلام) . They were jealous and, on account of their jealousy, they were inhibited from embracing the Faith. But in their heart of hearts they knew that Sayyidna Muhammad ﷺ was the Final Messenger of Allah. When, in the battle of Badr, they saw the amazing victory of the Muslims and the humiliating defeat of the pagan Quraish, their degree of certainty was somewhat augmented. They even expressed their amazement. But distinguishing between truth and falsehood on the basis, measurement, or standard of the apparent victory and defeat is a weak yardstick. As a result, when in the battle of Uhud, Muslims initially suffered a temporary setback and some of the Companions ؓ were martyred, their certainty was shaken. After that they started conspiring with the pagan Arabs.</p><p>When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ migrated to Madinah, as stated earlier, he with his political sagacity felt his first task was to enter into a peace treaty with the Jews of Madinah and other neighbouring Jewish tribes, stipulating that he would not fight them and they would not fight him, nor would they aid and abet those who take up arms against the Muslims, and if the Jews were attacked, the Muslims would assist them. There were many other clauses in the peace accord, the details of which are available in 'Sirah of Ibn Hisham'. All the Jewish tribes, including Banu Nadir, had their area, strong fortresses and orchards at a distance of 3.2 kilometers from Madinah.</p><p>Up to the point of the battle of 'Uhud, they apparently kept to the terms of the treaty. But after that battle, they betrayed the treaty and started conspiring secretly, in that a leader of Banu Nadir, Ka'b Ibn Ashraf, went to Makkah with a caravan of forty Jewish members to curry favour with the pagan Quraish who were anxious to avenge the defeat of the battle of Badr, and had gone to the battle of 'Uhud for that reason but were eventually defeated in the latter battle as well. The defeated men returned and the Jews met them. They conspired and agreed to wage a war against the Messenger of Allah and the Muslims. Ka'b Ibn Ashraf with his forty Jewish members and Abu Sufyan with his forty members of pagan Quraish entered the Sacred Mosque and, holding on the curtain of the House of Allah, pledged that they would jointly fight the Muslims and annihilate them.</p><p>When, after this pledge, Ka'b Ibn Ashraf returned to Madinah, Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) descended and informed the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the entire episode and the details of the pledge. In the meantime, the Holy Prophet ﷺ issued the command to kill Ka'b Ibn Ashraf. A noble Companion Muhammad Ibn Maslamah killed him.</p><p>Subsequently, Banu Nadir hatched many different plots to harm the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ، one of which was, as reported earlier, their plot to kill him. The Holy Prophet ﷺ ، after collecting blood money from the Muslims in a particular case of murder, decided to collect money from the Jews in terms of the treaty that was concluded between himself ﷺ ، the tribes of Banu Nadir, Banu Qainuqa` and Banu Quraizah. Before his arrival, they planned to kill him, as detailed above. The person who was entrusted with the task of throwing a rock on the head of the Holy Prophet ﷺ was a Jew ` Umar Ibn Jahhash by name who had volunteered himself for the task. Had it not been for the revelatory information the Holy Prophet ﷺ ; received from Allah, their plot would have worked. But Allah protected His Messenger ﷺ and the conspiracy was thus thwarted and their plan failed.</p><p>A Lesson</p><p>It is a remarkable co-incidence that subsequently the entire Banu Nadir clan was expelled from Madinah except for two persons who embraced the Islamic Faith and were spared: One of them was ` Umar Ibn Jahhash and the other was his paternal uncle Yamin Ibn ` Amr Ibn Ka'b. [ Ibn Kathir ].</p><p>The Story of ` Amr Ibn Umayyah Damuri</p><p>Under the rubric of 'cause of revelation' above, reference was made to the incident that ` Amr Ibn Umayyah Damuri accidentally killed two men. The Muslims as well as the Jews had to jointly settle the blood-wit in terms of the treaty existing between them. The Holy Prophet ﷺ collected money from the Muslims for this purpose. Then he decided to collect money from the Jews. The Holy Prophet ﷺ visited the tribe of Banu Nadir in their area for this purpose. Ibn Kathir writes that the enemy plans to harm the Muslims are many and long-drawn-out. One famous incident in Islamic history is that of Bi'r Ma` unah: Some of the hypocrites and the non-believers requested the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to send a band of the noble Companions ؓ to preach the religion of Islam. He dispatched about seventy Companions ؓ for the purpose. Later on it was discovered that this was a mere conspiracy. The plan was to surround them and kill them, in which they succeeded. Of the seventy Muslims, only ` Amr Ibn Umayyah Damuri managed to escape. He had seen and experienced the dishonesty and treachery of the non-believers, and how they mercilessly massacred sixty-nine of his brethren. In the circumstances, one can imagine how his emotions would have been against the enemies. Co-incidentally, when he was returning to Madinah he encountered two non-believers and killed them. Later on it was discovered that the two men killed were members of Bani ` Amir, a tribe which was an ally of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Banu Nadir was also an ally of Bani ` Amir tribe.</p><p>The agreements of Muslim politicians were not like the political agreements of today in which every effort is made at the very beginning to find out ways to escape or violate it. In the case of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and the early sincere Muslims, whatever the tongue uttered or the pen wrote was treated as part of religion and Divine law and binding. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ learnt about ` Amr Ibn 'Umayyah Damrui's error of judgment, he decided to pay the blood-wit, in terms of the sacred law of Shari’ ah, for the two men killed. In this matter, he first collected money from the Muslims and then he had to go to Banu Nadir for collection. [ Ibn Kathir ]</p><p>Tolerance and Human Rights in Islam: A Model for Present-day Politicians</p><p>There are many lessons in the incidents cited above for the heralds of human rights, and for the political leaders and the big powers who talk highly about them and are deemed as 'Champions of Human Rights'. Let us look at the case of Banu Nadir: They unceasingly were involved in conspiracies, endlessly behaved treacherously and continuously plotted to kill the Messenger of Allah ﷺ . Would the present-day political leaders or heads of governments tolerate all this? How would they treat them? Nowadays, the opponents are killed even by sprinkling petrol on them or in some other execution style. There is no need for political leadership or government for that purpose. A few wicked hooligans gather together and carry out the executions. The official wrath and anger manifest itself much more grievously.</p><p>But here we are describing the government of Allah and His Messenger ﷺ : Even when the enemy conspiracies and treacheries reached the peak, no massacre was contemplated. No thought of usurping their property and wealth was ever considered. In fact, the following humane punitive measures were taken:</p><p>[ 1]\tThey were allowed to take all their wealth with them, and were ordered only to evacuate the town.</p><p>[ 2]\tTo do this, they were given ten days, so that they might be able to take their things comfortably and transfer themselves to some other place. When they did not comply, it became necessary to take a sterner measure at national level.</p><p>[ 3]\tSome trees were though cut down and others were burned down, but even at that stage, no edict was issued to burn down their fortresses or attack them and kill them on a large scale.</p><p>[ 4]\tWhen they expressed that it was in their best interests to go into exile, they were given the choice that each man could take with him as much provisions as his camel could carry. As a result, they carried their hooks, latches, doors, planks, beams and rafters.</p><p>[ 5] No Muslim ever frowned upon any of the persons transferring his stuff. They took their things and moved out peacefully and safely.</p><p>The Holy Prophet ﷺ showed this kindness to them when they were completely subdued and he was in complete command of the situation. He had the power to fully avenge their treachery, dishonesty and conspiracy. But he did not do it. This behavior of the Holy Prophet ﷺ corresponds to his behavior with the pagans of Makkah when he entered the city after the triumph.</p><p>Let us now explain some expressions of these verses in the background of these events.</p>"

Bunlar, Peygamber sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem’in peygamberliği sırasında Medine yakınlarında bulunan yahudilerden büyük bir kesim idiler. Peygamber sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem’e peygamberlik verilip de Medine’ye hicret edince bunlar da diğer kâfir olan yahudiler gibi kâfir oldular.\nPeygamber sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem Medine’de komşusu olan yahudi kesimlerle antlaşmalar yaptı. Bedir gazvesinden altı ay civarında bir süre sonra Peygamber sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem onların bulundukları yerlere gitti ve Amr b. Umeyye ed-Damri’nin öldürdüğü Kilab oğullarına mensup kişilerin diyetini ödemesi için <span class=\"green\">(aralarındaki antlaşma gereği)</span> kendisine yardımcı olmalarını istedi.<span class=\"blue\"> \nOnlar:</span> Olur, yardım ederiz, ey Ebu’l-Kasım. Şurada bir süre otur da senin isteğini yerine getirelim, dediler. Bir köşeye çekilip başbaşa verdiler. Şeytan da haklarında yazılmış olan bedbahtlık fermanını onlara süslü gösterdi.<span class=\"blue\"> Kendi aralarında Peygamber sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem’e suikast kararı alıp şöyle dediler:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Sizden kim şu değirmen taşını alır da yukarı çıkıp onu başının üzerine atarak kafasını parçalar?”</span> \nAralarında en bedbaht kişi olan Amr b.<span class=\"blue\"> Cahhâş:</span> Ben yaparım, dedi. Sellam b.<span class=\"blue\"> Mişkem de onlara:</span> Böyle bir şey yapmayın. Allah’a andolsun ki yapmak istediğiniz iş, ona haber verilecektir. Ayrıca bu bizimle onun arasındaki ahdi bozmak demektir, dedi. Derhal Rabbinden Peygamber sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem’e ne yapmak istediklerine dair ilâhî vahiy geldi. \nPeygamber sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem hızlıca yerinden kalktı ve Medine’ye doğru gitti.<span class=\"blue\"> Ashabı da arkasından ona yetişerek:</span> Biz farkına bile varamadan sen kalkıp yola koyuldun, deyince o da kendilerine, yahudilerin ne yapmak istediklerini haber verdi.<span class=\"blue\">\nRasûlullah sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem onlara şu haberi gönderdi:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Medine’den çıkıp gidin ve orada benimle birlikte bir arada kalmayın. Ben size on günlük süre tanıyorum. Bu süreden sonra sizden kimi bulursam boynunu vuracağım.”</span>\nGünlerce hazırlıklarını sürdürdüler. Münafık Abdullah b. Ubey b.<span class=\"blue\"> Selûl da onlara şu haberi gönderdi:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Yurtlarınızdan çıkmayın. Beraberimde iki bin kişi var. Bunlar, sizinle birlikte hisarlarınıza girecek ve sizin uğrunuzda ölünceye dek çarpışacaklardır. Diğer taraftan Kurayzalılar da Gatafanlılardan antlaşma yaptığınız kimseler de size yardım edecektir.”</span>\nBaşkanları Huyey b. Ahtab,<span class=\"blue\"> münafıkların başının kendisine söylediklerinden umutlandı ve Rasûlullah sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem’e:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Biz yurdumuzdan çıkıp gitmiyoruz, artık ne istersen yap”</span>, diye haber gönderdi.\nRasûlullah sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem ve ashabı tekbir getirerek onların üzerine gitmek üzere harekete koyuldular. Sancağı Ali b. Ebu Talib radıyallahu anh taşıyordu. Kalelerinin etrafını kuşattılar ve bir süre onlara ok ve taş yağdırdılar. Kurayzalılar yardımlarına gelmediği gibi Abdullah b. Ubey b. Selûl ile Gatafanlılardan antlaşmalıları olan kimseler de onlara ihanet etti. Rasûlullah sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem onları kuşattı ve çevrede bulunan onlara ait hurma ağaçlarını kestirip yaktı.<span class=\"blue\"> \nBunun üzerine ona:</span> Medine’den çıkıyoruz, diye haber gönderdiler. Peygamber sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem oradan kendi canlarını, çoluk çocuklarını ve silah dışında develerinin taşıyabileceği kadar malları beraberlerinde almak şartı ile kalelerinden inmelerine müsaade etti ve geride kalan mallara ve silâhlara da el koydu. \nNadiroğullarından ele geçirilen mallar, Rasûlullah sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem’e, onun ihtiyaçlarına ve müslümanların maslahatına harcanıyordu. Bu malların beşte dördünü o, gazilere dağıtmamıştı. Çünkü Yüce Allah, burayı ona fey <span class=\"green\">(savaşsız ganimet)</span> olarak tahsis etmişti. Müslümanlar orayı ele geçirmek üzere ata binip deve koşturmamışlardı. \nPeygamber sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem onları Hayber’e sürdü. Aralarında liderleri Huyey b. Ahtab da vardı. Onların topraklarını ve diyarlarını ele geçirdi. Orada bıraktıkları silahlara da el koydu. Silahlar arasında elli zırh, elli miğfer ve üç yüz kırk tane kılıç vardı. Siyer alimlerinin sözünü ettikleri üzere kıssalarının özü bundan ibarettir.                </div><p lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        1.

Çünkü O, her şeye boyun eğdirmiş olan Azîzdir. Kimse O’na karşı koyamaz ve O’nun için zor diye bir şey yoktur.\nYaratması ve emretmesi, sonsuz hikmetlerle dolu olan Hakîm’dir. O, boşuna hiçbir şey yaratmaz. Maslahat ihtiva etmeyen hiçbir hükmü teşrî’ buyurmaz. Hikmetinin gerektirmediği hiçbir iş yapmaz.                </p><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        2. Bunlardan birisi de O’nun, Rasûlüne küfre sapmış Kitap ehlinden olan Nadiroğullarına karşı, Allah Rasûlü ile antlaşmalarını bozmaları üzerine yardım etmiş olmasıdır. Böylece o, onları alışageldikleri ve pek sevdikleri yurtlarından çıkarmıştır. Onların oradan çıkartılmaları, Allah’ın haklarında Rasûlü Muhammed sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem vasıtası ile takdir etmiş olduğu ilk sürgün idi ve bu sürgün Hayber’e gerçekleşmişti. \nÂyet-i kerime <span class=\"green\">(ilk sürgün ifadesi)</span> onların bunun dışında başka sürgünlerinin olduğuna da delildir. Nitekim Peygamber sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem onları Hayber’den de sürmüştür. Daha sonra Ömer radıyallahu anh da onlardan geriye kalanları oradan sürmüştü.\nEy müslümanlar! <span class=\"brown\">“Siz onların”</span> yurtları oldukça korunaklı ve kendileri de güçlü olması dolayı ile yurtlarından <span class=\"brown\">“çıkacaklarını sanmıyordunuz. Onlar da kalelerinin kendilerini Allah’a karşı koruyacağını sanıyorlardı.”</span> Bu yüzden kalelerini şımarıklık derecesinde beğenmiş, fakat aldanmışlardı. Bu kaleleri içerisinde oldukları sürece kendilerine zarar verilemeyeceğini, kimsenin onlara güç yetiremeyeceğini zannetmişlerdi. Fakat Allah’ın kaderi her şeyin üstündedir. Hisarların ve kalelerin O’na karşı bir faydası olmayacağı gibi gücün ve savunmanın da bir faydası olmaz.<span class=\"blue\"> Bundan dolayı Yüce Allah şöyle buyurmuştur:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Fakat Allah onlara hiç hesaba katmadıkları bir taraftan geldi.”</span> Yani onlar hatırlarından geçirmedikleri, hiç düşünmedikleri bir taraftan baskın ve hücuma maruz kaldılar.\nBu ummadıkları husus,<span class=\"blue\"> şöylece ifade edilmektedir:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Ve kalplerine korku saldı.”</span> Kalplerindeki bu şiddetli korku, Allah’ın en büyük ordusudur. Ona karşı ne sayının, ne araç gerecin, ne gücün, ne de kuvvetli oluşun bir faydası yoktur. Onların kanaatine göre eğer onlara bir zarar gelecek olsaydı bu, ancak arkasında korundukları ve huzur buldukları kalelerinden olabilirdi. Ama Allah’tan başkasına güvenen yardımsız kalır. Allah’tan başkasına meyledenin bu tutumu, kendi aleyhinedir. Bu nedenle sabır ve sebatın yahut gevşeklik ve zaafın yeri olan kalplerine semavî bir emir gelip onları buldu. Kalplerindeki gücü ve metaneti ortadan kaldırdı. Bunların yerine zaaf, gevşeklik ve korkaklık yerleştirdi. Bunu önleyebilecek güçleri de yoktu. Bu da onlara karşı müminlere ilahi bir yardımdı.<span class=\"blue\"> Bundan dolayı Yüce Allah şöyle buyurmaktadır:</span>\n\"<span class=\"green\">(Öyle ki)</span> evlerini hem kendileri kendi elleri ile tahrip ediyorlardı hem de mü’minlere <span class=\"green\">(tahrip ettiriyorlardı)</span>.” Çünkü Peygamber sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem ile mallarından develerinin taşıyabileceği kadar yük alacakları şekilde anlaşma yapmışlardı. Bundan dolayı evlerinin beğendikleri yerlerini, tavanlarının pek çoğunu dahi bozdular. Azgınlıkları sebebi ile yurtlarının tahrip edilmesi ve kalelerinin yıkılması konusunda mü’minleri kendi başlarına kendileri musallat ettiler. Bu yapılanlara kendileri sebep oldular ve kendilerine en büyük zararı kendileri verdiler.\n\"O halde ibret alın, ey basiret” mükemmel akıl ve eşyanın özünü kavrayan sağlam görüş <span class=\"brown\">“sahipleri!”</span> Çünkü bu, gerçekten Allah’ın hakka karşı inatlaşan ve hevâlarana uyan kimselere karşı neler yaptığının anlaşılmasına yardımcı olacak bir ibret vesilesidir. Bu kimselerin günahları sebebi ile Allah’ın emri gelip onları bulduğunda, ibretli cezalar onları yakaladığında güçlerinin kendilerine bir faydası olmamış, kuvvetleri onları koruyamamış, hisarları ve kaleleri de kendilerini himaye edememiştir.\nAsıl muteber olan sebebin hususiliği değil, mananın umumiliğidir. O nedenle bu âyet-i kerime genel olarak ibret almanın emredilmiş bir husus olduğuna delil olmaktadır. İbret alma ise birbirine benzeyen şeyleri göz önünde bulundurmak, bir şeyi kendisine benzeyen başka bir şeye kıyas etmektir. Ahkâmın içerdiği ve yeri akıl ve düşünce olan mana ve hikmetler üzerinde tefekkür etmektir. Bu sayede akıl kemâle erer, basiret aydınlanmış olur. İman artar ve gerçek anlamı ile kavrayış husule gelir.                </div><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        3. Daha sonra Yüce Allah, bu yahudilerin başına hak ettikleri ve lâyık oldukları her şeyin henüz gelip kendilerini bulmadığını,<span class=\"blue\"> Allah’ın onların musibetlerini nispeten hafifletmiş olduğunu haber vererek şöyle buyurmaktadır:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Eğer Allah onların hakkında”</span> kendilerine isabet eden <span class=\"brown\">“sürgünü” hiçbir şekilde değişmesi, değişikliğe uğratılması söz konusu olmayan olan kader ve kazası gereği “yazıp takdir etmemiş olsa idi, onları elbette dünyada azaba uğratırdı.”</span> Dünyadaki azapları ve ibretli cezaları başka türlü olurdu.\nAma onlar, dünyevî çetin azaptan kurtulmuş iseler dahi âhirette onlar için ateş azabı vardır ki onun ağırlığını Allah’tan başka kimsenin bilmesine imkân yoktur. \nOnlar, cezalarının bittiğini ve geriye çekecekleri herhangi bir cezanın kalmadığını sakın sanmasınlar. Allah’ın onlar için hazırladığı âhiret azabı daha büyük ve daha ağırdır.                </div><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        4. <span class=\"brown\">“Bunun sebebi onların Allah’a ve Rasûlüne muhalefet etmeleridir.”</span> Onlara düşmanlık etmeleri, savaş açmaları ve onlara isyan olan hususlarda çalışıp çabalamalarıdır. O’nun, kendisine karşı gelip düşmanlık eden kimseler hakkındaki sünneti/kanunu budur. <span class=\"brown\">“Kim Allah’a muhalefet ederse <span class=\"green\">(bilsin ki)</span> Allah cezası pek çetin olandır.”</span>\n</div><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        5. Nadiroğullarının, Allah Rasûlünü ve müslümanları hurma ağaçlarını kestikleri için kınamaları ve bunun yeryüzünde fesadın bir parçası olduğunu iddia edip müslümanlara dil uzatmak için bunu bahane yapmaları üzerine Yüce Allah, onların hurma ağaçlarını kesmelerinin de oldukları halde bırakmalarının da <span class=\"brown\">“hep Allah’ın izni”</span> ve emri dahilinde olduğunu haber vermiştir. \nBu da <span class=\"brown\">“Allah'ın fâsıkları alçaltması içindir.”</span> Çünkü sizlere hurma ağaçlarını kesip yakma imkânını O, vermiştir. Ta ki bu, onlar için dünya hayatında ibretli bir ceza ve aşağılanma sebebi olsun. Böylelikle tam anlamı ile âciz olduklarını anlayacakları bir zillete düşsünler. Ayrıca onlar güçlerinin esas kaynağını teşkil eden hurma ağaçlarını dahi kurtaracak güçlerinin olmadığını anlasınlar. \n(Âyet-i kerimede geçen <span class=\"brown\">“hurma ağacı”</span> anlamındaki): “لِّينَةٍ ” kelimesi, en doğru ve en uygun ihtimale göre bütün hurma ağaçlarını kapsayan bir ifadedir. \nİşte Nadiroğullarının durumu ve Allah’ın dünyada onlar için hazırladığı âkıbetin ne olduğu böylece anlaşılmış olmaktadır.<span class=\"blue\"> Daha sonra Yüce Allah Nadiroğullarına ait malların ve eşyaların kimlerin eline geçtiğini söz konusu ederek şöyle buyurmaktadır:</span>\n</div><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        6. <span class=\"brown\">“Allah’ın onlar<span class=\"green\">(ın malların)</span>dan”</span> yani o şehrin ahalisi olan Nadiroğullarından <span class=\"brown\">“Rasûlüne verdiği feye/ganimete gelince”</span> ey müslümanlar! <span class=\"brown\">“siz, onun için ne at koşturdunuz ne de deve.”</span> Yani bunları ele geçirmek için ne kendiniz yoruldunuz, ne de bineklerinizi yordunuz. Aksine Yüce Allah, onların kalplerine korku saldı da bu mallar, elinize kendiliklerinden ve siz onlar için çalışıp çabalamadan elinize geçmiş oldu.<span class=\"blue\"> Bundan dolayı Yüce Allah şöyle buyurmuştur:</span>\n\"Fakat Allah peygamberlerini dilediği kimselere hakim kılar. Allah her şeye gücü yetendir.<span class=\"blue\">” O’nun mükemmel kudretinin bir gereği de şudur:</span> Hiçbir iş O’na imkânsız değildir, hiç kimse O’nun gücüne sığınmadan güçlü olamaz.<span class=\"blue\">\nFakihlerin ıstılahına göre “fey”in tarifi:</span> Kâfirlerden savaşmaksızın ve hak yolla alınan mallardır. Nadiroğullarının müslümanlardan korktukları için bırakıp gittikleri mallar buna örnektir.\nBuna <span class=\"green\">(kök olarak dönmek anlamına gelen)</span> fey adının verilmesinin sebebi, bu malın, onu hak etmeyen kâfirlerden onun en büyük hak sahipleri olan müslümanlara dönmesindir.<span class=\"blue\"> Fey’in genel hükmünü ise Yüce Allah şu buyruklarında zikretmektedir:</span>\n</div><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        7. <span class=\"brown\">“Allah’ın” genel olarak ister Allah Rasûlü zamanında olsun, ister ondan sonra ümmetinden yönetim görevini üstlenen kimseler vasıtası ile olsun “ülkeler ahalisinden Rasûlüne verdiği fey/ganimet; Allah’a, Peygambere, akrabalara, yetimlere, yoksullara ve yolda kalmışlara aitir.”</span> Bu âyet-<span class=\"blue\">i kerime Enfâl Sûresi’nde yer alan Yüce Allah’ın şu buyruğuna benzemektedir:</span>\n\"Eğer Allah’a Furkan günü olan, o iki ordunun birbirleri ile karşılaştıkları günde kulumuza indirdiğimize inanmışsanız bilin ki ganimet olarak aldığınız herhangi bir şeyin beşte biri Allah’a, Rasûlüne, yakınlara, yetimlere, yoksullara ve yolculara aittir.” <span class=\"green\">(el-Enfâl, 8/41)</span> \nBurada sözü edilen fey’ beşe bölünür: Allah’a ve Rasûlüne ait olan beşte bir, müslümanların genel maslahatlarına harcanır.\nBir beşte bir <span class=\"brown\">“akrabalara”</span> yani Haşimoğulları ile Muttaliboğullarına -var olmaları halinde- verilir. Bu hususta erkeklerine de kadınlarına da eşit pay verilir. Burada Haşimoğulları ile birlikte Muttaliboğullarının da bu beşte bire girmelerinin,<span class=\"blue\"> buna karşılık Abdimenaf oğullarının geri kalanlarının girmeyişlerinin sebebi şudur:</span> Muttaliboğulları da Haşimoğulları ile birlikte Şi’bi Ebi Talib’de muhasara/boykot altında idiler. Söz konusu muhasara ise Kureyşlilerin onlardan uzak kalmak ve onlara düşmanlık etmek üzere akitleştikleri bir boykot dönemi idi. Muttaliboğulları diğerlerinin aksine Rasûlullah sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem’e yardımcı oldular.<span class=\"blue\"> Bundan dolayı Peygamber sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem Abdülmuttalib oğulları hakkında şöyle demiştir:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Onlar ne cahiliye döneminde ne İslâm döneminde benden ayrılmadılar.”</span>\nBir beşte bir de babaları bulunmayan ve henüz ergenlik yaşına gelmemiş kimseler demek olan fakir yetimlere verilir.\nBir beşte bir pay da yoksullara, diğer beşte bir de yolda kalmışlaradır. Yolda kalmışlar, vatanlarında bulunmayan, bu nedenle de ortada kalmış yabancılar demektir.\nYüce Allah’ın fey’i bu şekilde takdir edip sadece sözü edilen bu kimselere has kılmasının sebebine gelince bu, <span class=\"brown\">“o <span class=\"green\">(fey)</span> içinizden zengin olanlar arasında dönüp dolaşan”</span> ve yalnızca onların elinde kalan bir servet <span class=\"brown\">“olmasın” diyedir. Çünkü Yüce Allah, bunu bu şekilde takdir etmemiş olsaydı, zenginler ve güçlüler arasında bu mal döner dolaşır, bunların dışında kalan acizler bu maldan hiçbir şey elde edemezdi. Bu ise Allah’tan başka kimsenin bilemeyeceği çapta büyük bir fesada sebep olurdu. Halbuki Allah’ın emir ve şeriatine tabi olmakta sayısız büyük maslahatlar söz konusudur. Bundan dolayı Yüce Allah,<span class=\"blue\"> bu türlü kaideyi ve genel esası şöylece emretmektedir:</span>\n\"Peygamber size ne verirse onu alın, neyi yasaklarsa ondan da uzak durun.”</span> Bu buyruk, dinin inanç esaslarını da, ahkamını da, zahirini de batınını da kapsar. Rasûlün getirdiği ne varsa kulların kesin olarak onu alması veona uyması gerekir. Ona muhalefet edilmesi helâl değildir. Rasûl herhangi bir şeye dair açık bir hüküm bildirecek olursa bu, Yüce Allah’ın hüküm bildirmesi gibidir. Onu terk etmekte hiçbir kimse mazur değildir, kimseye ruhsat da verilmemiştir. Herhangi bir kimsenin söylediklerinin onun söylediğinin önüne geçirilmesi de caiz değildir.\nDaha sonra Yüce Allah, kendisinden korkup sakınmayı yani takvâlı olmayı emretmektedir. Zira takvâ ile kalpler ve ruhlar mamur olur. Dünya ve âhiret düzelir. Ebedi mutluluk ve pek büyük kurtuluş, takvâ ile elde edilir. Takvâ yitirilecek olursa ebedi bedbahtlık ve sonu gelmez bir azap söz konusu olur.<span class=\"blue\"> O bakımdan Yüce Allah şöyle buyurmaktadır:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Allah’tan korkup sakının; çünkü Allah”</span> takvâyı terk eden ve hevâya uymayı tercih eden kimselere karşı <span class=\"brown\">“cezası çok çetin olandır.”</span>\n</div><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        8-9. Daha sonra Yüce Allah, bu fey’ mallarını tahsis ettiği bu kimselere ayırmasını gerektiren sebebi ve hikmeti söz konusu etmekte ve bu malların kendilerine ayrılmasını hak ettiklerini, yardım görmeye haklarının bulunduğunu belirtmektedir. Çünkü onlar, ya Allah’ın rızasını elde etmek ve dinini desteklemek için Rasûlüne besledikleri sevgi dolayısı ile sevip alıştıkları yurtlarını, vatanlarını, sevdiklerini, dostlarını ve mallarını terk ve hicret etmiş muhacirlerdir. Ki bunlar <span class=\"brown\">“<span class=\"green\">(özü sözü)</span> doğru olanların ta kendileridir.”</span> Çünkü imanlarının gereklerini yerine getirmişler, salih amelleri ile zor ve ağır ibadetleri ile imanlarını tasdik etmiş kimselerdir. Bu yönleri ile onlar, iman ettiği iddiasında bulunup da onu cihad, hicret ve buna benzer ibadetler ile tasdik etmeyenlerden farklıdırlar. \nYa da bu kimseler, kendi istek ve iradeleri ile severek ve tercih ederek Allah’a ve Rasûlü’ne iman eden, Evs ve Hazreclilerden oluşan Ensârlardır. Bunlar Rasûlullah sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem’e kucak açmışlar, insanlara karşı onu korumuşlar, hicret ve iman diyarını yurt edinmişlerdi. Öyle ki burası mü’minlerin kendisine başvuracakları, dönecekleri bir sığınak haline gelmişti. Muhacirler de buraya gelip sığındılar, müslümanlar bu diyarın sınırları içerisinde yerleştiler. Çünkü o vakit bütün bölgeler savaş, şirk ve kötülük diyarı idi. Dinin yardımcıları olanlar hep Ensar’a sığınırlardı. İslâm yayılıncaya, güçleninceye ve peyderpey hakimiyeti artıncaya kadar bu böyle sürdü. Nihâyet kalpleri ilim, iman ve Kur’ân ile, ülkeleri de kılıç ve mızraklar ile fethettikleri vakte kadar bu böyle sürdü.<span class=\"blue\">\nBunların güzel vasıfları arasında şu da vardır:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Kendilerine hicret edenleri severler.”</span>Bunun sebebi de Allah’a ve Rasûlüne besledikleri sevgidir. Bu yüzden O’nun sevdiklerini de sevdiler ve dinine yardımları dokunanlara da yardımcı oldular.<span class=\"brown\">“ve onlara verilenlerden dolayı içlerinde bir çekememezlik duymazlar.”</span> Allah’ın lütfundan onlara verdikleri, onlara tahsis etmiş olup da hak ettikleri pek üstün fazilet ve konumlarından dolayı muhacirleri kıskanmazlar. Bu, onların kalplerinin ne kadar temiz olduğuna, kalplerinde hile, kin ve haset bulunmadığına delildir. \nBu buyruk muhacirlerin, ensardan faziletli olduğuna da delildir. Çünkü Allah, önce muhacirlerden söz etmiş, daha sonra da Ensar’ın muhacirlere verilenlerden dolayı kalplerinde herhangi bir kıskançlık beslemediklerini belirtmiştir. Bu da Yüce Allah’ın muhacirlere, ne ensara ne de başkalarına vermediği şeyleri verdiğine delildir. Çünkü onlar hem dine yardım etmişler, hem de hicret etmişlerdi.\n\"Kendileri ihtiyaç içinde bulunsalar dahi <span class=\"green\">(din kardeşlerini)</span> kendilerine tercih ederler.” Yani Ensarın başkalarına üstün geldikleri vasıflarından, kendilerini diğerlerinden ayırt eden özelliklerinden birisi de başkasını kendine tercih etmektir <span class=\"green\">(îsâr)</span>. Bu da cömertliğin en mükemmel çeşididir. Zira o, mal ve daha başka nefsin sevdiği şeylerde başkalarını knedine tercih etmek, onlara bizzat muhtaç olmakla hatta zorunlu olarak gerek duymakla ve darlık içerisinde bulunmakla birlikte onları başkasına seve seve verebilmektir.\nBu, ancak son derece temiz bir ahlâktan, Yüce Allah’a duyulan ve nefsin zevk alıp arzu ettiği şeylerin önüne geçirilen ilahi bir sevgiden kaynaklanabilir.\nKendisinin ve çoluk çocuğunun yiyeceğini misâfirlerine takdim eden ve çoluk çocuğu ile birlikte geceyi aç geçiren Ensar’a mensup bir sahabinin kıssası da buna örnektir ki bu âyet de ondan dolayı nazil olmuştur.\nÎsâr <span class=\"green\">(başkasını kendisine tercih etmek)</span> benciliğin/egoizmin aksidir ve iyi bir şeydir. Bencillik/egoizm ise yerilmiş bir şeydir. Çünkü o, cimriliğin ve eli sıkılığın özelliklerindendir. Kendisine îsâr özelliği ihsan edilmiş bulunan kimse, nefsinin cimriliğine karşı korunmuş kimse demektir ki <span class=\"brown\">“Kim nefsinin cimriliğinden korunursa işte onlar, kurtuluşa erenlerin ta kendileridir.”</span> Nefsin cimrilikten korunması, emrolunduğu bütün hususlarda cimrilik etmekten korunmasını kapsar. Buna göre kul, nefsinin cimriliğine karşı korunacak olursa Allah ve Rasûlü’nün emirlerini rahatlıkla ve kolaylıkla yerine getirir. İsteyerek ve itaat etmek arzusu ile tam bir kalp huzuru ile bunları yapar. Yine gönül isteği ile Allah’ın yasakladıklarını terk eder. İsterse bu yasakları nefsi sevsin, onları işlemeye çağırsın ve onları arzulasın. Yine böyle bir kimse, Allah yolunda ve Allah’ın rızası uğrunda mallarını seve seve harcar. Bu yolla da kurtuluşu elde eder ve umduklarına nail olur. Oysa nefsinin cimriliğine karşı korunamayarak hayra karşı cimrilik etmeye müptela olanlar, böyle değildir. Şerrin esası ve temel kaynağı da işte budur.                </div><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        10. Zikri geçen bu iki faziletli ve üstün sınıf, sahabe-i kiramdır ve önderlerdir. Bunlar öne geçmiş, pek çok faziletlere sahip olmuşlardır. Bunlar vasıtası ile kendilerinden sonra gelenleri geçmişler, kendilerinden öncekilere de yetişmişlerdir. Bu sebeple onlar, mü’minlerin en ileri gelenleri, müslümanların efendileri ve takvâ sahiplerinin liderleridirler. Onlardan sonra gelen kimselerin onların arkasından yürümeleri ve onların hidâyetlerini takip etmeleri fazilet olarak onlara yeter. Bundan dolayı Yüce Allah,<span class=\"blue\"> sonradan gelenler arasından onların izinden gidenleri söz konusu ederek şöyle buyurmaktadır:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Onlardan” Muhacir ve Ensardan “sonra gelenler”</span> hem kendilerinin hem diğer mü’minlerin iyiliklerini isteyerek <span class=\"brown\">“derler ki: Rabbimiz, bizi ve bizden önce iman etmiş olan kardeşlerimizi bağışla!”</span> \nBu, önceden iman etmiş olan ashabı kiramı, onlardan öncekileri ve onlardan sonrakilerini içeren bütün mü’minleri kapsayan bir duadır. Bu da imanın faziletlerinden birisidir. Şöyle ki mü’minler birbirlerinden yararlanırlar ve aralarındaki iman ortaklığı dolayısı ile birbirlerine dua ederler ki bu iman da mü’minler arasındaki kardeşliğin sebebidir. Bu kardeşliğin bir parçası da birbirlerine dua etmeleri ve birbirlerini sevmeleridir. Bundan dolayı Yüce Allah, bu dualarında kalplerinden azı ile çoğu ile her türlü kinin giderilmesini istediklerini zikretmektedir. Kin kalpten giderilecek olursa, onun zıddı yerleşir ki bu da mü’minler arasındaki sevgi, dostluk, dayanışma, samimi olarak onların iyiliğini isteme vb. gibi mü’minlerin haklarından olan hususları ihtiva eder. \nYüce Allah, ashab-ı kiramdan sonra gelen bu dua sahiplerini de iman sahibi olmakla nitelendirmektedir.<span class=\"blue\"> Çünkü onların:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Ve bizden önce iman etmiş olan kardeşlerimizi”</span> ifadeleri, imanda onların da onlara ortak olduklarına, ashab-ı kirama iman ve itikad esaslarında tabi olduklarına delildir. Bunlar da bu niteliğin tam anlamı ile ancak kendileri hakkında söz konusu olduğu ehl-i sünnet ve’l-cemaattir.\nOnların bir diğer vasfı ise günahlarını itiraf etmek, bunlardan dolayı Allah’tan bağışlanma dilemek, birbirleri için de af ve mağfiret istemek, mü’min kardeşlerine karşı kalplerindeki kin ve olumsuz duyguları izale etmek için çalışmaktır. Çünkü onların bu şekilde dua etmeleri sözünü ettiğimiz hususları gerektirmekte ve birbirlerini sevdiklerini ifade etmektedir. Yine onların her birinin kendisi için istediğini kardeşi için de istediğini, yanında olsun, gıyabında olsun, hayatta iken veya ölümünden sonra olsun mü’min kardeşinin iyiliğini istediğini de ifade etmektedir. Yine bu ayet-i kerime bu sayılanların, mü’minlerin birbirlerine karşı hakları arasında yer aldığını da göstermektedir.\nDaha sonra mü’minler, bu dualarını Yüce Allah’ın rahmetinin kemâline, O’nun mü’minlere olan lütuf, ihsan ve şefkatinin ileri derecesine delil teşkil eden iki güzel ismiyle sona erdirmektedirler. Allah’ın onlar üzerindeki rahmet ve ihsanının bir tecellisi hatta en üstün şekli de onlara gerek kendisine karşı gerek diğer kullarına karşı yerine getirmeleri gereken hakları yerine getirme tevfikini ihsan etmiş olmasıdır.\nİşte bu üç sınıf, bu ümmetin sınıflarını oluşturur. Bunlar fey’in, İslâm’ın maslahatlarına dönük olan harcama yerlerini teşkil eden ve fey’e de layık olan kimselerdir. Allah lütuf ve ihsanı ile bizleri de bu sınıflardan kılsın.                </div><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        11. Daha sonra Yüce Allah, münafıkların hallerinin hayret edilecek bir hal olduğunu belirtmektedir. Zira bu münafıklar, Kitap ehlinden <span class=\"green\">(küfürde)</span> kardeşleri olan kimselere,<span class=\"blue\"> mü’minlere karşı yardımcı olacaklarını ve onların yanında yer alacaklarını vaat etmişler ve onlara şöyle demişlerdi:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Eğer siz <span class=\"green\">(yurdunuzdan)</span> çıkartılırsanız andolsun biz de sizinle beraber çıkarız. Sizin aleyhinizde hiçbir kimseye asla itaat etmeyiz.”</span> Yani size yardımcı olmama konusunda bizi engelleyecek yahut korkutacak hiç kimsenin sözünü dinlemeyiz.\n\"ve eğer size savaş açılırsa kesinlikle size yardım ederiz.” Halbuki Allah şahitlik eder ki onlar” kardeşlerini aldatıp kandırdıkları bu sözlerinde <span class=\"brown\">“kesinlikle yalancıdırlar.”</span> doğru söylemiyorlar. \nOnların bu tutumları da garip karşılanmaz. Çünkü yalan söylemek onların özelliği, aldatmak ve kandırmak da ayrılmaz vasıflarıdır. Münafıklık ve korkaklık da onların yakasını bırakmaz. Bundan dolayı Yüce Allah, şu buyruğu ile -ki verdiği haber aynen vukua gelmiş ve tıpkı bildirdiği gibi gerçekleşmiştir-<span class=\"blue\"> onların yalancılıklarını bildirmek üzere şöyle buyurmaktadır:</span>\n</div><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        12. <span class=\"brown\">“Eğer onlar”</span> sürgüne gönderilmek üzere yurtlarından <span class=\"brown\">“çıkartılırlarsa”</span> vatanlarını sevdiklerinden, savaşma dirençleri olmadığından ve sözlerinde durmadıklarından dolayı <span class=\"brown\">“onlarla birlikte çıkmazlar. Eğer onlara savaş açılırsa onlara yardım etmezler.”</span> Aksine korkaklık onları çepeçevre kuşatır, başıbozukluk onlara hakim olur. Kardeşlerine en muhtaç oldukları bir zamanda yardım etmez, onları desteksiz bırakırlar.\n\"Onlara” faraza <span class=\"brown\">“yardım etseler bile gerisin geri kaçarlar, sonra kendilerine de yardım edilmez.”</span> Yani savaştan ve yardımdan gerisin geriye dönüp kaçarlar. Allah’tan onlara hiçbir şekilde de yardım edilmeyecektir.                </div><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        13.<span class=\"blue\"> Onları böyle davranmaya iten sebep ise şudur:</span> Ey mü’minler! <span class=\"brown\">“İçlerinde size karşı duydukları korku, Allah korkusundan çok daha fazladır.”</span> Allah’tan çok sizden korkarlar. Ne kendisine ne da başkalarına herhangi bir fayda sağlayamayan, bir zararı da önleyemeyen yaratılmışların korkusunu, fayda ve zararı elinde bulunduran ve istediğine verip istediğinden de alan Yaratıcının korkusunun önüne geçirmişlerdir.\n\"Bu da onların anlamayan bir topluluk olmalarındandır.” İşlerin önem mertebelerini anlamazlar, eşyanın hakikatini bilmezler, akıbetleri düşünmezler. Halbuki asıl anlayış ve kavrayış, Allah’tan korkmanın, O’ndan ummanın ve O’nu sevmenin, diğer bütün hususların önüne geçirilmesi ve başka şeylerin onlara tabi kılınmasıdır.                </div><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        14. <span class=\"brown\">“Onlar sizinle toplu olarak”</span> yani bir arada <span class=\"brown\">“<span class=\"green\">(yüz yüze)</span> değil de ancak korunaklı şehirlerde yahut da surların arkasından savaşırlar.”</span>Size karşı savaşta sebat gösteremezler ve böyle bir savaşa girişemezler; ancak korunaklı şehirlerde koruma altında yahut surların ve duvarların arkasında bulunurlarsa o zaman savaşa kalkışırlar. Bu yolla kendilerini nispeten koruyabilirler. Bunu da cesaretlerinden değil kalelerine ve surlarına güvendikleri için yaparlar. Bu ifade onları çok ağır şekilde yermektedir.<span class=\"brown\">“Kendi aralarındaki savaşları şiddetlidir.”</span> Yani kendi aralarında çetin savaşırlar. Bu konuda ne bedenlerinde ne de güçlerinde herhangi bir eksiklik yoktur. Asıl eksikleri, onların imanlarındaki zafiyette ve onların sözbirliği etmeyişlerindedir.<span class=\"blue\"> Bundan dolayı şöyle buyurmaktadır:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Sen onları”</span> bir araya gelmiş ve birbirlerini destekler halde gördüğünde <span class=\"brown\">“birlik içinde sanırsın, ama kalpleri darmadağınıktır.”</span>Birbirlerine kin beslerler ve ayrılık içindedirler.<span class=\"brown\">“Bu” sözü geçen sıfatlarla nitelendirilmelerini gerektiren hal, “onların akıllarını kullanmayan bir topluluk olmalarındandır.”</span> Akılları fikirleri yoktur. Akılları bulunsa idi üstün olanı değersize tercih ederlerdi. Kendileri adına daha değersiz olanı seçmezlerdi. Sözbirliği ederler, kalpleri birbirine kaynaşırdı. Bu yolla da birbirlerine yardımcı olurlar, birbirlerini desteklerlerdi. Dinî ve dünyevi maslahatları hususunda birbirlerine yardımcı olurlardı.                </div><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        15. Ehli kitaptan yardımsız bırakılan ve Allah’ın, kendilerine karşı Rasûlüne zafer verip dünya hayatında rüsvaylığı tattırdığı, ayrıca kendilerine yardımcı olacaklarını vaat eden kimselerin yardımından da mahrum kalan bu kimselerin durumu <span class=\"brown\">“kendilerinden yakın bir zaman önce yaptıklarının vebalini tatmış olanların durumu gibidir.”</span> Bunlar da şeytanın kendilerine amellerini süslü gösterdiği Kureyş kâfirleridirler.<span class=\"blue\"> Şeytanın bunlara neler söylediklerini Yüce Allah bize şöylece haber vermektedir:</span>\n\"Bugün insanlar içinde sizi yenebilecek yoktur. Ben de muhakkak sizin yardımcınızım.” İki ordu birbirini görünce <span class=\"green\">(şeytan)</span> iki topuğu üstüne gerisin geri kaçarak: <span class=\"brown\">“Benim sizinle hiçbir ilişkim yok. Gerçekten ben sizin göremeyeceğinizi görüyorum. Ben muhakkak Allah’tan korkarım. Çünkü Allah cezası çok şiddetli olandır, demişti.”</span><span class=\"green\">(el-Enfâl, 8/48)</span>\nBöylelikle nefisleri kendilerini aldatmış, kendilerine fayda sağlayamayacak ve azabı onlardan uzaklaştıramayacak kimseler de onları kandırmıştı. Nihâyet böbürlenerek ve büyüklük taslayarak Bedir’e kadar geldiler. Rasûlullah sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem’e ve mü’minlere arzuladıkları gibi zarar verebileceklerini sandılar. Allah ise Rasûlünü ve mü’minleri onlara muzaffer kıldı. Onlar da müşriklerin ileri gelenlerini öldürdüler, pek çok kimseyi de esir aldılar. Diğerleri ise kaçıp kurtulmaya çalıştı. Böylelikle <span class=\"brown\">“onlar yaptıklarının vebalini”</span> şirk ve azgınlıklarının sonundaki cezasını <span class=\"brown\">“tatmış” oldular. Bu, dünyadaki cezaları idi. Âhirette ise “onlar için can yakıcı bir azap vardır.”</span>\n</div><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        16.

Zira o,<span class=\"blue\"> insana:</span> “Kâfir ol”</span> der.” Yani şeytan böyle bir kimseye küfrü allayıp pullar, güzel gösterir ve küfre davet eder. O kimse de şeytana aldanıp kâfir olup bedbahtlık yolunu seçince daha önce kendisini bunlara davet eden ve dostu olduğunu ileri süren şeytanın ona hiçbir faydası olmaz. Aksine o,<span class=\"blue\"> ondan uzaklaştığını bildirir:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Ben senden uzağım. Çünkü ben âlemlerin Rabbi olan Allah’tan korkarım”</span> der.” Yani sana gelen azabı önleyecek gücüm yoktur.

O, onları çağırır ve kendileri için zararlı olabilecek şeylere doğru aldatarak onları çeker. Nihâyet tuzağa düşüp de helâkin sebepleri onları çepeçevre kuşattığında onları terk edip gider. \nOna itaat edenler ne kadar kınansalar azdır! Çünkü Allah, ondan sakındırmış, ona karşı uyarmış, onun amaçlarını ve nihaî âkıbetini haber vermiştir. Ona itaat etmeye kalkışan kimse, bilerek Allah’a isyan ediyor demektir. Bu konuda onun hiçbir mazereti olamaz.                </div>"

نضیر یہودیوں کا ایک بڑا قبیلہ تھا جو نبی ٔاکرمﷺ کی بعثت کے وقت مدینہ کے مضافات میں آباد تھا۔ جب نبی ٔاکرمﷺ مبعوث ہوئے اور آپ نے مدینہ کی طرف ہجرت کی تو انھوں نے جملہ یہود کے ساتھ آپ کی نبوت کا انکار کر دیا،  نبی ٔاکرم ﷺ نے یہود کے ان قبائل کے ساتھ معاہدہ کیا جو مدینہ منورہ میں آپ کے پڑوس میں آباد تھے۔ غروۂ بدر کے تقریباً چھ ماہ بعد نبی اکرم ﷺ ان کے پاس گئے اور ان سے گفتگو کی کہ <span class=\"grﷺﷺn\">(معاہدے کے مطابق)</span> وہ ان کلابیوں کی دیت کے بارے میں آپ کی مدد کریں،  جن کو عمرو بن امیہ ضمری نے قتل کیا تھا۔ انھوں نے کہا ’’اے ابوالقاسم! ہم آپ کی مدد کریں گے آپ یہاں بیٹھیے،  یہاں تک کہ ہم آپ کے لیے دیت اکٹھی کردیں، چنانچہ وہ تنہائی میں ایک دوسرے سے ملے اور شیطان نے ان کے لیے اس بدبختی کو آسان بنا دیا جو ان کے لیے لکھ دی گئی تھی، چنانچہ انھوں نے آپ کے قتل کی سازش کی اور آپ کے بارے میں کہنے لگے ’’تم میں سے کون ہے جو اس چکی کو اٹھائے چھت پر چڑھ کر آپ کے سر پر دے مارے اور اس سے آپ کا سر کچل ڈالے؟<span class=\"bluﷺ\">‘‘\nان میں سے بدبخت ترین شخص عمرو بن جحاش نے کہا:</span> ’’یہ کام میں کروں گا‘‘      سَلَام بِن مِشْکَمْ نے ان سے کہا ’’یہ کام نہ کرواللہ کی قسم! تمھارے ارادے سے اسے ضرور آگاہ کر دیا جائے گا،  اور یہ اس معاہدے کی بھی خلاف ورزی ہے  جو ہمارے اور اس کے درمیان ہوا ہے۔‘‘     \nانھوں نے جو سازش کی تھی اس کے بارے میں آپ پر فوراً وحی نازل ہو گئی،  آپ جلدی سے وہاں سے اٹھ گئے اور مدینہ کا رخ کیا اور آپ کے صحابہ بھی <span class=\"grﷺﷺn\">(جو ساتھ گئے تھے)</span> آپ سے مل گئے اور عرض کیا ’’آپ وہاں سے اٹھ آئے اور ہمیں خبر بھی نہ ہوئی۔‘‘      آپ نے انھیں اس سازش کے بارے میں آگاہ فرمایا جو یہودیوں نے آپ کے خلاف کی تھی۔ رسول اللہ ﷺ نے یہودیوں کو پیغام بھجوایا کہ ’’مدینہ سے نکل جاؤ   اور اس میں مت رہو،  میں تمھیں دس دن کی مہلت دیتا ہوں،  اس کے بعد میں نے جس کسی کو مدینہ میں پایا،  اس کی گردن مار دوں گا۔‘‘     \nبنونضیر مدینہ منورہ میں کچھ دن ٹھہرے اور <span class=\"grﷺﷺn\">(وہاں سے نکلنے کی)</span> تیاری کرتے رہے،  عبداللہ بن ابی ابن سلول منافق نے ان کو پیغام بھجوایا ’’اپنے گھروں سے مت نکلو،  میرے ساتھ دو ہزار آدمی ہیں  جو تمھارے ساتھ تمھارے قلعے میں داخل ہوں گے اور تمھاری خاطر اپنی جان دیں گے،  بنوقریظہ اور بنوغطفان میں سے تمھارے حلیف بھی تمھاری مدد کریں گے۔‘‘     \nبنونضیر کا سردار حُیَي بن اخطب،  عبداللّٰہ بن اُبَّی کے کہنے میں آ گیا اور رسول اللہ ﷺ کو کہلا بھیجا ’’ہم اپنے گھروں سے نہیں نکلیں گے،  جو چاہو  کر لو‘‘      رسول اللہ ﷺ اور صحابہ کرام نے نعرۂ تکبیر بلند کیا اور یہود کی طرف روانہ ہوئے۔ حضرت علیt نے جھنڈا اٹھا رکھا تھا۔ یہودی اپنے قلعوں میں مقیم ہو کر پتھر اور تیر پھینکنے لگے،  بنوقریظہ ان سے الگ ہو گئے،  عبداللہ بن ابی اور بنو غطفان میں سے ان کے حلیفوں نے بھی ان سے خیانت کی۔ رسول اللہ ﷺ نے ان کا محاصرہ کر لیا،  ان کے کھجوروں کے باغات کاٹ کر نذر آتش کر دیے،  بنونضیر نے پیغام بھیجا کہ ہم مدینہ سے نکل جائیں گے،  رسول اللہ ﷺ نے ان پر یہ شرط عائد کی کہ وہ اپنی اولاد کو لے کر نکل جائیں اور اسلحہ کے سوا وہ سب کچھ لے جائیں جو ان کے اونٹ اٹھا سکتے ہیں۔ رسول اللہ ﷺ نے ان کے مال اور اسلحہ کو اپنے قبضے میں لے لیا۔\nبنونضیر کے اموال خالص رسول اللہ ﷺ کی مہمات اور مسلمانوں کے مصالح کے لیے تھے،  آپ نے اس مال میں سے خمس نکالا،  کیونکہ یہ مال اللہ تعالیٰ نے آپ کو دلوایا تھا،  مسلمانوں نے گھوڑوں اور اونٹوں کے ساتھ ان پر چڑھائی نہیں کی تھی۔ رسول اللہ ﷺ نے بنونضیر کو خیبر کی طرف جلا وطن کر دیا،  ان میں ان کا سردار حُیَيبن اخطب بھی شامل تھا  اور ان کی اراضی اور گھروں پر قبضہ کر لیا۔ نیز ان کے اسلحہ کو بھی قبضہ میں لے لیا،  اسلحہ میں پچاس زر ہیں،  پچاس خود اور تین سو چالیس تلواریں ہاتھ لگیں۔ یہ ہے بنونضیر کے قصے کا ماحصل  جیسا کہ اسے اہل سیرت نے بیان کیا ہے۔                </div><div lang=\"ur\" class=\"ur \">\n<span class=\"brown\">[2]</span>    یہ اس کی حکمت ہے کہ جب اہل کتاب میں سے بنونضیر نے اس کے رسول کے ساتھ بدعہدی کی تو اس نے ان کے مقابلے میں اپنے رسول ﷺ کی مدد کی پس اللہ تعالیٰ نے ان کو ان کے گھروں اور وطن سے نکال دیا،  جن سے وہ محبت کرتے تھے،  ان کا اپنے گھروں اور وطن سے نکالا جانا  اولین جلا وطنی ہے  جو اللہ تعالیٰ نے ان کے لیے  رسول اللہ ﷺ کے ہاتھوں  خیبر کی طرف مقدر ٹھہرائی۔\nیہ آیت کریمہ دلالت کرتی ہے کہ اس جلا وطنی کے علاوہ بھی ان کو جلا وطنی کا سامنا کرنا پڑا  اور یہ وہ جلا وطنی ہے جو خیبر سے رسول اللہﷺ کے ہاتھوں واقع ہوئی،  پھر حضرت عمرt نے <span class=\"grﷺﷺn\">(اپنے عہد خلافت میں)</span>بقیہ تمام یہودیوں کو خیبر سے نکال دیا۔\nاللہ تعالیٰ نے فرمایا:  <span class=\"arabic

کوئی قابو پا سکتا ہے۔ اس کے ماوراء اللہ تعالیٰ نے ایک ایسا امر مقدر کر دیا،  جس سے انھیں ان کی محفوظ پناہ گاہیں بچاسکیں نہ قلعے،<span class=\"bluﷺ\">  اور نہ قوت اور مدافعت ہی کام آسکی۔\nاس لیے فرمایا:</span><span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿ فَاَتٰىهُمُ اللّٰهُ مِنۡ حَيۡثُ لَمۡ يَحۡتَسِبُوۡا﴾</span> ’’پس اللہ نے انھیں وہاں سے آلیا جہاں سے انھیں گمان بھی نہیں تھا۔‘‘         یعنی اس طریقے اور اس راستے سے جس کے بارے میں انھیں وہم و گمان میں بھی نہ تھا کہ یہاں سے ان کو آ لیا جائے گا۔ اور وہ یہ بات تھی  <span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿ وَقَذَفَ فِيۡ قُلُوۡبِهِمُ

نہیں جانتا۔ \nاللہ تعالیٰ کے حکم اور اس کی شریعت کی اتباع میں اتنی زیادہ مصلحتیں ہیں  جو شمار سے باہر ہیں۔اس لیے اللہ تعالیٰ نے ایک قاعدہ کلیہ اور ایک عام اصول مقرر فرمایا:  <span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿ وَمَاۤ اٰتٰىكُمُ الرَّسُوۡلُ فَخُذُوۡهُ١ۗ وَمَا نَهٰؔىكُمۡ عَنۡهُ فَانۡتَهُوۡا ﴾</span>  ’’رسول تمھیں جو دے،  وہ لے لو اور جس سے وہ تمھیں روک دے،  اس سے رک جاؤ۔‘‘      یہ آیت کریمہ  دین کے اصول و فروع اور اس کے ظاہر و باطن سب کو شامل ہے،  نیز یہ آیت کریمہ دلالت کرتی ہے کہ رسول اللہ ﷺ جو کچھ لے کر آئے ہیں،  اس سے تمسک کرنا اور اس کی اتباع کرنا  بندوں پر فرض ہے اور اس کی مخالفت کرنا جائز نہیں۔ نیز اس آیت کریمہ سے ثابت ہوتا ہے کہ کسی چیز کے حکم پر رسول اللہ ﷺ کی نص،  اللہ تعالیٰ کی نص کی مانند ہے  اور اس کو ترک کرنے میں کسی کے لیے کوئی رخصت اور عذر نہیں اور  کسی کے قول کو آپ کے قول پر مقدم رکھنا جائز نہیں۔\nپھر اللہ تعالیٰ نے اپنے تقویٰ کا حکم دیا جس سے دنیا و آخرت میں قلب و روح معمور ہوتی ہے،  تقویٰ ہی میں دائمی سعادت اور فوز عظیم ہے۔ تقویٰ کو ضائع کرنے میں ابدی بدبختی اور سرمدی عذاب ہے،<span class=\"bluﷺ\"> چنانچہ فرمایا:</span><span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿ وَاتَّقُوا اللّٰهَ١ؕ اِنَّ اللّٰهَ شَدِيۡدُ الۡعِقَابِ﴾</span>  ’’اور اللہ سے ڈرتے رہو،

ہیں اور اس بات کے مستحق ہیں کہ ان کے لیے فَے میں حصہ مقرر کیا جائےاور یہ ان مہاجرین کے مابین ہے جنھوں نے اللہ تعالیٰ میں رغبت اور رسول اللہ ﷺ کی محبت کی خاطر،  اپنے محبوب و مالوف گھر بار، وطن،  دوستوں اور احباب کو چھوڑ دیا۔ یہی لوگ سچے ہیں،  جنھوں نے اپنے ایمان کے تقاضے کے مطابق عمل کیا،  اعمال صالحہ اور مشقت آمیز عبادت کے ذریعے سے اپنے ایمان کی تصدیق کی بخلاف ان لوگوں کے جنھوں نے ایمان کا دعویٰ کیا مگر ہجرت اور جہاد وغیرہ عبادات کے ذریعے سے اپنے ایمان کی تصدیق نہ کی، نیز  انصار  یعنی اوس اور خزرج کے مابین ہیں  جو اپنی خوشی،  محبت اور اختیار سے ایمان لائے۔ جب عرب کے تمام شہر  دارالحرب،  شرک اور شر کا گڑھ تھے تب انھوں نے رسول اللہ ﷺ کو پناہ دی،  سرخ و سیاہ سے آپ کی حفاظت کی،  دار ہجرت و ایمان میں اقامت کی یہاں تک کہ دار ہجرت ایک ایسا مرجع بن گیا جس کی طرف مومنین رخ کرتے تھے،  جہاں مہاجرین پناہ لیتے اور اس کی چراگاہوں میں مسلمان سکونت اختیار کرتے۔\n  پس دین کی مدد کرنے والے  انصار کے پاس پناہ لیتے رہے،  یہاں تک کہ اسلام پھیل گیا،  اس نے طاقت پکڑ لی اور اس میں آہستہ آہستہ اضافہ ہوتا گیا،<span class=\"bluﷺ\">  حتیٰ کہ مسلمانوں نے علم و ایمان اور قرآن کے ذریعے سے دلوں کو اور شمشیر و سناں کے ذریعے سے شہروں کو فتح کر لیا  جن کے جملہ اوصاف جمیلہ یہ ہیں:</span><span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿يُحِبُّوۡنَ مَنۡ هَاجَرَ اِلَيۡهِمۡ﴾</span> ’’وہ اپنی طرف ہجرت کرکے آنے والوں سے محبت کرتے ہیں۔‘‘ یہ اس وجہ سے ہے کہ وہ اللہ اور اس کے رسول سے محبت کرتے ہیں،  اس کے احباب سے محبت کرتے ہیں اور ان لوگوں سے محبت کرتے ہیں جو اس کے دین کی مدد کرتے ہیں۔ <span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَلَا يَجِدُوۡنَ فِيۡ صُدُوۡرِهِمۡ حَاجَةً مِّؔمَّاۤ اُوۡتُوۡا﴾</span>’’اور و ہ اپنے دلوں میں اس <span class=\"grﷺﷺn\">(مال)</span> کی کوئی حاجت نہیں پاتے جو ا ن <span class=\"grﷺﷺn\">(مہاجرین)</span> کو دیا جائے۔‘‘   یعنی اللہ تعالیٰ نے اپنے فضل و کرم سے مہاجرین کو جو کچھ عطا کیا ہے اور ان کو جن فضائل و مناقب سے مختص کیا جن کے وہ اہل ہیں،  وہ ان پر حسد نہیں کرتے۔ یہ آیت کریمہ ان کے سینے کی سلامتی،  ان میں بغض،  کینہ اور حسد کے عدم وجود پر دلالت کرتی ہے،  نیز یہ آیت کریمہ اس امر پر دلالت کرتی ہے کہ مہاجرین،  انصار سے افضل ہیں ، اس لیے کہ اللہ تعالیٰ نے ان کے ذکر کو مقدم رکھا ہے۔نیز آگاہ فرمایا کہ مہاجرین کو جو کچھ عطا کیا گیا انصار اس کے بارے میں اپنے دلوں میں کوئی حسد محسوس نہیں کرتے۔ یہ آیت کریمہ یہ بھی دلالت کرتی ہے کہ اللہ تعالیٰ نے مہاجرین کو وہ فضائل عطا کیے جو انصار اور دیگر لوگوں کو عطا نہیں کیے کیونکہ انھوں نے نصرت دین اور ہجرت کو جمع کیا۔\n <span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَيُؤۡثِرُوۡنَ عَلٰۤى اَنۡفُسِهِمۡ وَلَوۡ كَانَ بِهِمۡ خَصَاصَةٌ﴾</span>   ’’اور اپنی ذات پر <span class=\"grﷺﷺn\">(ان کو)</span>ترجیح دیتے ہیں اگرچہ خود انھیں سخت ضرورت ہو۔‘‘ یعنی انصار کے اوصاف میں سے ایک وصف ایثار ہے،  جس کی بنا پر وہ دوسروں پر فوقیت رکھتے ہیں اور ان سے ممتاز ہیں،  اور یہ کامل ترین جود و سخا ہے  اور نفس کے محبوب اموال وغیرہ میں ایثار کرنا اور ان اموال کے خود حاجت مند بلکہ ضرورت مند اور بھوکے ہونے کے باوجود دوسرے پر خرچ کرنا، یہ وصف اخلاق زکیہ،  اللہ تعالیٰ سے محبت،  پھر شہوات نفس اور اس کی لذات پر اس کی محبت کو مقدم رکھنے ہی سے حاصل ہو سکتا ہے۔\nجملہ واقعات میں اس انصاری کا قصہ بھی بیان کیا جاتا ہے  جس کے سبب سے یہ آیت کریمہ نازل ہوئی ہے  جب اس نے اپنے اور اپنے گھر والوں کے کھانے میں اپنے مہمان کو ترجیح دی اور تمام گھر والوں اور بچوں نے رات بھوکے بسر کی۔<span class=\"grﷺﷺn\">(اِیثَارٌ)</span> ’’ترجیح دینا‘‘ <span class=\"grﷺﷺn\">(اَثْرَۃٌ  )</span> ’’خود غرضی‘‘ کی ضد ہے۔  ایثار قابل تعریف وصف ہے اور خود غرضی مذموم ہے کیونکہ یہ بخل اور حرص کے خصائل کے زمرے میں آتی ہے ، اور جسے ایثار عطا کیا گیا اسے نفس کے بخل و حرص سے بچا لیا گیا۔ <span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَمَنۡ يُّوۡقَ شُحَّ نَفۡسِهٖ فَاُولٰٓىِٕكَ هُمُ الۡمُفۡلِحُوۡنَ﴾</span>  ’’اور جو کوئی اپنے نفس کی حرص سے بچا لیا گیا تو وہی لوگ فلاح یاب ہیں۔‘‘ اور نفس کے حرص سے بچنے میں  ان تمام امور میں حرص سے بچنا شامل ہے جن کا حکم دیا گیا ہے،  جب بندہ نفس کی حرص سے بچ گیا،  تو اس کے نفس کو اللہ تعالیٰ اور اس کے رسول کے احکام آسان لگتے ہیں وہ خوشی سے سر تسلیم خم کرتے ہوئے انشراح صدر کے ساتھ ان کی تعمیل کرتا ہے،  اور نفس کے لیے ان تمام امور کو ترک کرنا سہل ہو جاتا ہے،  جن سے اللہ تعالیٰ نے روکا ہے،  خواہ یہ نفس کے محبوب امور ہی کیوں نہ ہوں اور   نفس ان کی طرف بلاتا اور ان کی طرف رغبت کیوں نہ دلاتا ہو۔ اس شخص کے نفس کے لیے،  اللہ تعالیٰ کی رضا کی خاطر،  اللہ تعالیٰ کے راستے میں مال خرچ کرنا آسان ہو جاتا ہے،  اور اسی سے فوز و فلاح حاصل ہوتی ہے،  برعکس اس شخص کے جو نفس کے بخل و حرص سے بچا ہوا نہیں بلکہ بھلائی کے بارے میں حرص کی بیماری میں مبتلا ہے،  اور یہ حرص شر کی جڑ اور اس کی بنیاد ہے۔\nپس اہل ایمان کی یہ دو فضیلت والی،  پاک اصناف ہیں اور وہ صحابہ کرام اور ائمہ اعلام ہیں جنھوں نے سابقیت کے اوصاف،  فضائل اور مناقب کو جمع کر لیا ان کے بعد کسی نے ان سے سبقت نہیں کی۔ صحابہ کرام y نے بھلائی میں پہلے لوگوں کو جا لیا اور اس طرح وہ مومنوں کے سربراہ،  مسلمانوں کے سردار اور اہل تقویٰ کے قائد بن گئے۔ ان کے بعد آنے والوں کے لیے یہی فضیلت کافی ہے کہ وہ ان کے نقش قدم پر چلیں اور ان کے طریق کو راہ نما بنائیں۔ اس لیے بعد میں آنے والوں میں سے جو کوئی ان کو راہ نما بناتا ہے،<span class=\"bluﷺ\">  اس کا ذکر کرتے ہوئے اللہ تعالیٰ نے فرمایا:</span>\n</div><div lang=\"ur\" class=\"ur \">\n<span class=\"brown\">[10]</span><span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿ وَالَّذِيۡنَ جَآءُوۡ مِنۢۡ بَعۡدِهِمۡ﴾</span>   یعنی جو<span

qpc-hafs brown\">﴿ رَبَّنَا اغۡفِرۡ لَنَا وَلِاِخۡوَانِنَا الَّذِيۡنَ سَبَقُوۡنَا بِالۡاِيۡمَانِ﴾</span>  ’’اے ہمارے پروردگار! ہمیں بخش دے اور ہمارے ان بھائیوں کو بھی جو ہم سے پہلے ایمان لاچکے ہیں۔‘‘ یہ دعا تمام گزرے ہوئے اہل ایمان،  صحابہ،  ان سے پہلے اور ان کے بعد آنے والے تمام اہل ایمان کو شامل ہے۔\nیہ ایمان کی فضیلت ہے کہ اہل ایمان ایک دوسرے سے فائدہ اٹھاتے ہیں اور ایمان میں مشارکت کے سبب سے ایک دوسرے کے لیے دعا کرتے ہیں،  ایمان مومنین کے درمیان اخوت کا تقاضا کرتا ہے،  جس کی فروع میں یہ بھی شامل ہے کہ وہ ایک دوسرے کے لیے دعا کریں اور ایک دوسرے سے محبت کریں۔ اس لیے اللہ تبارک و تعالیٰ نے اس دعا میں قلب سے کینہ کی نفی کا ذکر فرمایا جو قلیل و کثیر ہر قسم کے کینہ کو شامل ہے،  جب کینہ کی نفی ہو گئی تو اس کی ضد ثابت ہو گئی اور وہ ہے اہل ایمان کے مابین محبت و موالات اور خیر خواہی وغیرہ،  جو اہل ایمان کے حقوق شمار ہوتے ہیں۔\nپس اللہ تعالیٰ نے صحابہ کرام y کے بعد آنے والوں کو ایمان کے وصف سے موصوف کیا ہے،  کیونکہ ان کا قول  <span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿ سَبَقُوۡنَا بِالۡاِيۡمَانِ﴾</span>  ایمان میں ان کی مشارکت پر دلالت کرتا ہے۔ نیز اس سے ثابت ہوتا ہے کہ وہ عقائد،  ایمان اور اس کے اصول میں صحابہ کرام کی پیروی کرنے والے ہیں  اور وہ ہیں اہل سنت و الجماعت،  کیونکہ یہ وصف تام صرف انھی پر صادق آتا ہے۔ اللہ تعالیٰ نے ان کو گناہوں کے اقرار اور پھر ان گناہوں سے استغفار کے ساتھ موصوف کیا ہے۔ نیز یہ کہ وہ ایک دوسرے کے لیے استغفار کرتے ہیں اور مومن بھائیوں کے خلاف کینہ اور حسد کو ختم کرنے کی کوشش کرتے ہیں،  کیونکہ ان کا اس چیز کی دعا کرنا  ان امور کو مستلزم ہے اور جن کا ہم نے ذکر کیا ہے اور ان کے ایک دوسرے سے محبت کرنے کو مستلزم ہے اور اس امر کو بھی مستلزم ہے کہ ان میں سے کوئی اپنے بھائی کے لیے وہی کچھ پسند کرے جو اپنے لیے پسند کرتا ہے،  اس کی موجودگی اور عدم موجودگی میں،  اس کی زندگی میں اور اس کے مرنے کے بعد اس کی خیر خواہی کرے۔\nیہ آیت کریمہ دلالت کرتی ہے کہ یہ سب کچھ اہل ایمان کے ایک دوسرے پر جملہ حقوق ہیں، پھر انھوں نے اپنی دعا کو اللہ تعالیٰ کے دو اسمائے کریمہ پر ختم کیا جو اللہ تعالیٰ کے کمال رحمت اور شدت رأفت و احسان پر دلالت کرتے ہیں،  اس کے

’’اگر تم نکال دیے گئے تو ہم بھی تمھارے ساتھ ہی نکلیں گے۔ اور تمھارے بارے میں کبھی کسی کا کہنا نہیں مانیں گے۔‘‘         یعنی تمھاری نصرت و مدد کے بارے میں جو کوئی ہمیں برا بھلا کہے گا یا ڈرائے گا،  ہم تمھاری عدم نصرت میں اس کی اطاعت نہیں کریں گے  <span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿ وَّاِنۡ قُوۡتِلۡتُمۡ لَنَنۡصُرَنَّـكُمۡ١ؕ وَاللّٰهُ يَشۡهَدُ اِنَّهُمۡ لَكٰذِبُوۡنَ﴾</span>   ’’اور اگر تم سے جنگ

اہمیت نہ دیں،  کیونکہ جھوٹ  ان کا وصف،  فریب اور دھوکہ ان کے ساتھی،  نفاق اور بزدلی ان کے دوست ہیں۔                </div><div lang=\"ur\" class=\"ur \">\n<span class=\"brown\">[14]</span><span

হ্যাঁ, আমরা এ জন্যে প্রস্তুত আছি। এখনই আমরা আমাদের অংশ মুতাবিক সম্পদসহ আপনার খিদমতে হাযির হচ্ছি।” অতঃপর তারা তার নিকট হতে সরে গিয়ে পরস্পর পরামর্শ করলোঃ “এর চেয়ে বড় সুযোগে কি আর পাওয়া যাবে? এখন তিনি আমাদের হাতের মুঠোর মধ্যে রয়েছেন। এসো তাকে আমরা শেষ করে (হত্যা করে) ফেলি।” তারা পরামর্শক্রমে এ সিদ্ধান্ত গ্রহণ করলো যে, যে দেয়াল ঘেঁষে তিনি বসে আছেন ঐ ঘরের উপর কেউ চড়ে যাবে এবং সেখান হতে সে তার উপর একটি বড় পাথর নিক্ষেপ করবে। এতেই তাঁর জীবনলীলা শেষ হয়ে যাবে।আমর ইবনে জাহাশ ইবনে কা'ব এই কাজে নিযুক্ত হলো। অতঃপর কার্য সাধনের উদ্দেশ্যে সে ছাদের উপর আরোহণ করলো। ইতিমধ্যে আল্লাহ তা'আলা হযরত জিবরাঈল (আঃ)-কে স্বীয় নবী (সঃ)-এর নিকট পাঠিয়ে নির্দেশ দিলেন। যে, তিনি যেন সেখান হতে চলে যান। সুতরাং তিনি তৎক্ষণাৎ সেখান হতে উঠে চলে গেলেন, ফলে ঐ নরাধম তার উদ্দেশ্য সাধনে ব্যর্থ হলো। ঐ সময় রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ)-এর সাথে তাঁর কয়েকজন বিশিষ্ট সাহাবী ছিলেন। যেমন হযরত আবু বকর (রাঃ), হযরত উমার (রাঃ), হযরত আলী (রাঃ) প্রমুখ। তিনি সেখান হতে সরাসরি মদীনা অভিমুখে রওয়ানা হন। আর ওদিকে যেসব সাহাবী তাঁর সাথে ছিলেন না এবং মদীনাতেই তাঁর জন্যে অপেক্ষমান ছিলেন, তাঁরা তাঁর বিলম্ব দেখে ব্যতিব্যস্ত হয়ে পড়েন এবং তার খোঁজে বেরিয়ে পড়েন। কিন্তু একটি লোকের মাধ্যমে তারা জানতে পারেন যে, তিনি মদীনায় পৌছে গেছেন। সুতরাং তাঁরা ফিরে এসে রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-কে তাঁর বিলম্বের কারণ জিজ্ঞেস করেন। তখন রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) ঘটনাটি সবিস্তারে বর্ণনা করেন এবং তাঁদেরকে যুদ্ধের প্রস্তুতি গ্রহণের নির্দেশ দেন।সহাবীগণ তৎক্ষণাৎ যুদ্ধের জন্যে প্রস্তুত হয়ে যান এবং আল্লাহর পথে বেরিয়ে পড়েন। ইয়াহূদীরা মুসলিম সেনাবাহিনীকে দেখে তাদের দূর্গের ফটক বন্ধ করে দিয়ে তথায় আশ্রয় গ্রহণ করে। রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) তাদেরকে অবরোধ করেন এবং তাদের আশে-পাশের খেজুর বৃক্ষগুলো কেটে ফেলার ও জ্বালিয়ে দেয়ার নির্দেশ দেন। তখন ইয়াহুদীরা চীৎকার করে বলতে লাগলো যে, এটা হচ্ছে কি? যিনি অন্যদেরকে বিপর্যয় সৃষ্টি করতে নিষেধ করেন এবং বিপর্যয় সৃষ্টিকারীদেরকে মন্দ বলেন তিনি এটা কি করতে শুরু করলেন? সুতরাং একদিকে তো তাদের এই খেজুর বৃক্ষ কেটে ফেলার দুঃখ এবং অপরদিকে সাহায্য আসার যে কথা ছিল সেদিক হতে নৈরাশ্য, এ দু'টো বিষয় তাদের কোমর একেবারে ভেঙ্গ দিলো।  সাহায্যের ঘটনাটি এই যে, বানু আউফ ইবনে খাযরাজের গোত্রটি যার মধ্যে আবদুল্লাহ ইবনে উবাই ইবনে সালল, ওয়ালীআহ, মালিক ইবনে ককিল, সুওয়ায়েদ, আ'মাস প্রমুখ ব্যক্তিবর্গ ছিল, তারা বানী নাযীর গোত্রকে বলে পাঠিয়েছিলঃ “তোমরা মুকাবিলায় স্থির ও অটল থাকো, দূর্গ মুসলমানদের হাতে ছেড়ে দিয়ো না এবং আত্মসমর্পণ করো না, আমরা তোমাদের সাহায্যার্থে রয়েছি। তোমাদের শত্রু আমাদেরও শক্র। আমরা তোমাদের সাথে মিলিত হয়ে তাদের সাথে যুদ্ধ করবে। তোমরা যুদ্ধের জন্যে বের হলে আমরাও বের হবো।” কিন্তু তখন পর্যন্ত তাদের ঐ ওয়াদা পূর্ণ হয়নি। তারা ইয়াহুদীদের সাহায্যের জন্যে এগিয়ে আসেনি। এদিকে এই বানী নাযীর গোত্র ভীত-সন্ত্রস্ত হয়ে পড়েছে। সুতরাং তারা রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ)-এর নিকট আবেদন করলো যে, তিনি যেন তাদের প্রাণ রক্ষা করেন। তারা মদীনা ছেড়ে চলে যাচ্ছে। কিন্তু তারা তাদের ধন-সম্পদ ও আসবাবপত্রের যা কিছু তাদের উটের উপর বোঝাই করে নিয়ে যেতে পারবে তা যেন তাদেরকে নিয়ে যাওয়ার অনুমতি দেয়া হয়।রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) তাদের প্রতি দয়াপরবশ হয়ে তাদের আবেদন মঞ্জুর করেন এবং তারা তাদের আবাসভূমি ছেড়ে চলে যায়। যাবার সময় তারা তাদের ঘরের দরজাগুলো পর্যন্ত ভেঙ্গে ফেলে দিয়ে এগুলো সাথে নিয়ে যায় এবং ঘরগুলোও ভেঙ্গে ফেলে। এগুলো নিয়ে গিয়ে তারা সিরিয়া ও খায়বারে বসতি স্থাপন করে। তাদের অবশিষ্ট মালগুলো রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ)-এর জন্যে খাস হয়ে যায় যে, তিনি ইচ্ছামত ওগুলো খরচ করতে পারেন। ওগুলো তিনি ঐ সব লোকের মধ্যে বন্টন করে দেন যাঁরা প্রথম দিকে হিজরত করেছিলেন। আনসারদের মাত্র দু’জন দরিদ্র লোককে তিনি কিছু অংশ দেন। তাঁরা হলেন হযরত সাহল ইবনে হানীফ (রাঃ) ও হযরত সাম্মাক ইবনে খারশাহ (রাঃ)। বানু নাযীর গোত্রের মাত্র দু’জন লোক মুসলমান হয় যাদের ধন-সম্পদ তাদের কাছেই থেকে যায়। একজন হলো ইয়ামীন ইবনে আমর ইবনে কা'ব (রাঃ), যে আমর ইবনে জাহ্হাশের চাচাতো ভাই ছিল। যে ছিল ঐ আমর যে রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ)-কে পাথর দ্বারা হত্যা করার ঘৃণ্য সংকল্প করেছিল। দ্বিতীয়জন হলো সা’দ ইবনে অহাব (রাঃ)।একদা রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) হযরত ইয়ামীন (রাঃ)-কে সম্বোধন করে বলেনঃ “হে ইয়ামীন (রাঃ)! তোমার ঐ চাচাতো ভাইটিকে দেখো, সে আমার সাথে কি দুর্ব্যবহারই না করেছিল এবং আমার ক্ষতি সাধনের জন্যে কি ঘণ্য ষড়যন্ত্রেই না। লিপ্ত হয়েছিল!” তাঁর একথা শুনে হযরত ইয়ামীন (রাঃ) একটি লোকের মাধ্যমে তাকে হত্যা করেন। সূরায়ে হাশর বানু নাযীরের এই ঘটনা বর্ণনায় অবতীর্ণ হয়।হযরত ইবনে আব্বাস (রাঃ) বলেনঃ “হাশরের ভূমি হলো সিরিয়া দেশ। এ ব্যাপারে যদি কারো সন্দেহ থাকে তবে যেন সে (আরবী)-এ আয়াতটি পাঠ করে।”  রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) যখন ঐ ইয়াহূদীদেরকে বলেনঃ “তোমরা এখান হতে বেরিয়ে যাও।” তখন তারা বলেঃ “আমরা কোথায় যাবো?” উত্তরে তিনি তাদেরকে বলেনঃ “হাশরের ভূমির দিকে।”হযরত হাসান (রাঃ) বলেন যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) যখন বানু নাযীরকে নির্বাসন দেন তখন বলেনঃ “এটা হলো প্রথম হার এবং আমি এর পিছনে পিছনে রয়েছি।” (এটা ইমাম ইবনে জারীর (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)বানু নাযীরের ঐ দূর্গগুলোর অবরোধ মাত্র ছয়দিন পর্যন্ত ছিল। দূর্গাগুলোর দৃঢ়তা, ইয়াহূদীদের সংখ্যাধিক্য, মুনাফিকদের ষড়যন্ত্র ও গোপন চক্রান্ত ইত্যাদি দেখে অবরোধকারী মুসলমানদের এটা কল্পনাও ছিল না যে, তারা এতো তাড়াতাড়ি সব ছেড়ে দিয়ে চলে যাবে। আর ইয়হূদীরাও গর্বিত ছিল যে, তাদের দূর্গগুলো সবদিক দিয়েই সুরক্ষিত ও দুর্ভেদ্য। সুতরাং তারা মনে করেছিল যে, তাদের দুর্গগুলো তাদেরকে অবশ্যই রক্ষা করবে। কিন্তু আল্লাহর শাস্তি এমন এক দিক হতে আসলো যা ছিল তাদের ধারণাতীত। আল্লাহ্ তা'আলার নীতি এটাই যে, চক্রান্তকারীরা তাদের চক্রান্তের মধ্যেই থাকে, এমতাবস্থায় তাদের অজান্তে আকস্মিকভাবে তাদের উপর আল্লাহর শাস্তি এসে পড়ে। তাদের অন্তরে ত্রাসের সঞ্চার হয়। আর ত্রাসের সঞ্চার হবেই না বা কেন? তাদেরকে অররোধকারী ছিলেন এমন এক ব্যক্তি যাকে আল্লাহ্ তা'আলার পক্ষ হতে প্রভাব দান করা হয়েছিল। তাঁর নাম শুনে শত্রুদের অন্তর এক মাসের পথের ব্যবধান হতে কেঁপে উঠতো। তাঁর প্রতি দুরূদ ও সালাম বর্ষিত হোক!  ইয়াহূদীরা তাদের নিজেদের হাতে তাদের ঘর-বাড়ীগুলো ধ্বংস করতে শুরু করে। ছাদের কাঠ ও ঘরের দরজাগুলো নিয়ে যাবার জন্যে ভেঙ্গে ফেলতে থাকে। মুমিনদের হাতেও ওগুলো ধ্বংসপ্রাপ্ত হয়। তাই আল্লাহ্ তাবারাকা ওয়া তা'আলা বলেনঃ অতএব, হে চক্ষুষ্মন ব্যক্তিরা! তোমরা এটা হতে উপদেশ ও শিক্ষা গ্রহণ কর।এরপর মহামহিমান্বিত আল্লাহ বলেনঃ যদি ঐ ইয়াহুদীদের ভাগ্যে নির্বাসন লিপিবদ্ধ না থাকতো এবং আল্লাহ তাদের নির্বাসনের সিদ্ধান্ত গ্রহণ করে না থাকতেন তবে দুনিয়ায় তিনি তাদেরকে আরো কঠিন শাস্তি দিতেন। তাদেরকে হত্যা করা হতো ও বন্দী করা হতো। অতঃপর তাদের জন্যে পরকালে রয়েছে জাহান্নামের শাস্তি।বানু নাযীরের এ যুদ্ধ বদর যুদ্ধের ছয় মাস পরে সংঘটিত হয়েছিল। উট বোঝাই করে যত মাল তারা নিয়ে যেতে পারতো তা নিয়ে যাবার অনুমতি তাদেরকে দেয়া হয়েছিল। কিন্তু অস্ত্র-শস্ত্র নিয়ে যাবার অনুমতি তাদেরকে দেয়া হয়নি। তারা ছিল ঐ গোত্রের লোক যাদেরকে ইতিপূর্বে কখনো নির্বাসন দেয়া হয়নি। হযরত উরওয়া ইবনে যুবায়ের (রাঃ) বলেন যে, (আরবী) হতে (আরবী) পর্যন্ত আয়াতগুলো বানী নাযীরের এই ঘটনা সম্পর্কেই অবতীর্ণ হয়।শব্দের অর্থ ‘হত্যা’ এবং ধ্বংসও করা হয়েছে। রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) প্রতি তিনজনকে একটি করে উট এবং একটি করে মশক দিয়েছিলেন। এই ফায়সালার পরেও রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) হযরত মাসলামা (রাঃ)-কে তাদের নিকট পাঠিয়ে দেন এবং তাদেরকে অনুমতি প্রদান করেন যে, তারা যেন তিন দিনের মধ্যে নিজেদের আসবাব-পত্র ঠিকঠাক করে নিয়ে সেখান হতে প্রস্থান করে।  এই পার্থিব শাস্তির পরেই পারলৌকিক শাস্তিরও বর্ণনা দেয়া হচ্ছে যে, সেখানেও তাদের জন্যে জাহান্নামের আগুন অবধারিত রয়েছে। তাদের এই দুর্গতির প্রকৃত কারণ এই যে, তারা আল্লাহ্ ও তাঁর রাসূল (সঃ)-এর বিরুদ্ধাচরণ করেছে এবং একদিক দিয়ে তারা সমস্ত নবীকেই অস্বীকার ও অবিশ্বাস করেছে। কেননা, প্রত্যেক নবীই রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) সম্পর্কে ভবিষ্যদ্বাণী করে গেছেন। ঐ লোকগুলো তাকে পুরোপুরিভাবে চিনতো ও জানতো। এমনকি পিতা তার পুত্রকে যেমন চিনে তার চেয়েও অধিক তারা শেষ নবী (সঃ)-কে চিনতো। কিন্তু এতদসত্ত্বেও শুধু হিংসার কারণেই তাকে তারা মানতো না। এমনকি তাঁর বিরুদ্ধাচরণে তারা উঠে পড়ে লেগে যায়। আর প্রকাশ্য ব্যাপার এই যে, আল্লাহ্ তা'আলাও স্বীয় বিরুদ্ধাচারীদের উপর কঠিন শাস্তি অবতীর্ণ করে থাকেন।(আরবী) বলা হয় ভাল খেজুরের গাছকে। কারো কারো উক্তি মতে আজওয়াহ্ ও বিরনী এই প্রকার খেজুরগুলো লীনাহ্-এর অন্তর্ভুক্ত নয়। কেউ কেউ বলেন যে, শুধু আযওয়াহ লীনাহ্-এর অন্তর্ভুক্ত নয়। আবার কারো কারো মতে সর্বপ্রকারের খেজুরই এর অন্তর্ভুক্ত। বুওয়াইরাহ্ও এর অন্তর্ভুক্ত।  ইয়াহূদীরা যে তিরস্কারের ছলে বলেছিল যে, তাদের খেজুরের গাছগুলো কাটিয়ে দিয়ে হযরত মুহাম্মাদ (সঃ) নিজের উক্তির বিপরীত কাজ করতঃ ভূ-পৃষ্ঠে কেন বিপর্যয় সৃষ্টি করছেন? এটা তাদের ঐ প্রশ্নেরই জবাব যে, যা কিছু হচ্ছে সবই প্রতিপালকের নির্দেশক্রমে তার শত্রুদেরকে লাঞ্ছিত ও অকৃতকার্য করে দেয়ার লক্ষ্যেই হচ্ছে। যেসব গাছ বাকী রেখে দেয়া হচ্ছে সেটাও তাঁরঅনুমতিক্রমেই হচ্ছে এবং যেগুলো কাটিয়ে ফেলা হচ্ছে সেটাও যৌক্তিকতার সাথেই হচ্ছে।এটাও বর্ণিত আছে যে, মুহাজিরগণ একে অপরকে ঐ গাছগুলো কেটে ফেলতে নিষেধ করছিলেন এই কারণে যে, শেষে তো ওগুলো গানীমাত হিসেবে মুসলমানরাই লাভ করবেন, সুতরাং ওগুলো কেটে ফেলে লাভ কি? তখন আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা এ আয়াত অবতীর্ণ করেন যে, বাধাদানকারীরাও একদিকে সত্যের উপর রয়েছে এবং কর্তনকারীরাও সত্যের উপর রয়েছে। তাদের উদ্দেশ্য হলো মুসলমানদের উপকার সাধন করা এবং তাদের উদ্দেশ্য হলো কাফিরদেরকে রাগান্বিত করে তোলা এবং তাদের দুষ্কার্যের স্বাদ গ্রহণ করানো। এটাও এদের উদ্দেশ্য যে, এর ফলে এই শত্রুরা তেলে বেগুনে জ্বলে উঠবে এবং এরপর যুদ্ধক্ষেত্রে উপস্থিত হয়ে যাবে, তখন তাদের মন্দ কার্যের শাস্তি হিসেবে তাদেরকে তরবারী দ্বারা দ্বিখণ্ডিত করে দেয়া হবে।সাহাবীগণ এ কাজ তো করলেন বটে, কিন্তু পরক্ষণেই ভয় পেলেন যে, না জানি হয়তো ঐ খর্জুর বৃক্ষগুলো কেটে ফেলা অথবা বাকী রেখে দেয়ার কারণে তাদেরকে আল্লাহ্ তা'আলার নিকট জবাবদিহি করতে হবে। তাই তারা এ সম্পর্কে রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ)-কে জিজ্ঞাসাবাদ করলে আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা (আরবী)-এ আয়াতটি অবতীর্ণ করেন। অর্থাৎ দু'টোতেই প্রতিদান বা সওয়াব রয়েছে, কর্তন করার মধ্যেও এবং বাকী রেখে দেয়ার মধ্যেও।  কোন কোন রিওয়াইয়াতে রয়েছে যে, কেটে ফেলা এবং জ্বালিয়ে দেয়া। উভয়েরই নির্দেশ দেয়া হয়েছিল।ঐ সময় বানু কুরাইযা ইয়াহুদীদের প্রতি রাসূলুল্লাহ্ অনুগ্রহ করেছিলেন এবং তাদেরকে মদীনাতেই অবস্থানের অনুমতি দিয়েছিলেন। কিন্তু পরে তারাও যখন মুকাবিলায় নেমে পড়ে তখন তাদের মধ্যে যারা যুদ্ধে অবতীর্ণ হয়েছিল তাদেরকে হত্যা করা হয় এবং তাদের নারীরা, শিশুরা ও তাদের সম্পদগুলো মুসলমানদের মধ্যে বন্টিত হয়। হ্যাঁ, তবে তাদের মধ্যে যারা রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-এর খিদমতে। হাযির হয়ে ঈমান আনয়ন করে তারা রক্ষা পায়। অতঃপর মদীনা হতে সমস্ত উয়াহূদীকে বের করে দেয়া হয়। বানী কাইনুকাকেও, যাদের মধ্যে হযরত আবদুল্লাহ্ ইবনে সালাম (রাঃ) ছিলেন এবং বানী হারিসাকেও। সমস্ত ইয়াহদীকে নির্বাসন দেয়া হয়। এই সমুদয় ঘটনা আরব কবিরা তাঁদের কবিতার মধ্যে সুন্দরভাবে বর্ণনা করেছেন যা সীরাতে ইবনে ইসহাকে বর্ণিত হয়েছে। ইবনে ইসহাক (রঃ)-এর মতে এটা উহুদ ও বি’রে মাউনার পরবর্তী ঘটনা এবং উরওয়া (রঃ)-এর মতে এ ঘটনাটি বদর যুদ্ধের ছয় মাস পরে সংঘটিত হয়। এসব ব্যাপারে আল্লাহ তা'আলাই সবচেয়ে ভাল জানেন।</p>"

Maka ambillah <span class=\"green\">(kejadian itu)</span> untuk menjadi pelajaran, hai orang-orang yang mempunyai pandangan. Dan jikalau tidak-lah karena Allah telah menetapkan pengusiran terhadap mereka, benar-benar Allah akan mengazab mereka di dunia. Dan bagi mereka di akhirat azab neraka. Yang demikian itu adalah karena sesungguhnya mereka menentang Allah dan RasulNya. Barang-siapa menentang Allah, maka sesungguhnya Allah sangat keras hukumanNya.

Dan Allah Mahakuasa atas segala sesuatu. Apa saja harta rampasan <span class=\"green\">(fai`)</span> yang diberikan Allah kepada RasulNya yang berasal dari penduduk kota-kota, maka adalah untuk Allah, Rasul, kerabat Rasul, anak-anak yatim, orang-orang miskin dan orang-orang yang dalam perjalanan, supaya harta itu jangan hanya beredar di antara orang-orang kaya saja di antara kamu. Apa yang diberikan Rasul kepadamu, maka terimalah ia. Dan apa yang dilarangnya bagimu, maka tinggalkanlah; dan bertakwalah kepada Allah.

Sekalipun mereka memerlu-kan <span class=\"green\">(apa yang mereka berikan itu)</span>. Dan siapa yang dipelihara dari kekikiran dirinya, mereka itulah orang-orang yang beruntung. Dan orang-orang yang datang sesudah mereka <span class=\"green\">(Muhajirin dan Anshar)</span>, mereka berdoa, 'Ya Rabb kami, beri ampunlah kami dan saudara-saudara kami yang telah beriman lebih dahulu dari kami, dan janganlah Engkau membiarkan kedengkian dalam hati kami terhadap orang-orang yang beriman.

Dan Allah menyaksikan, bahwa sesungguhnya mereka benar-benar pendusta. Sesungguhnya jika mereka diusir, orang-orang munafik itu tiada akan keluar bersama mereka, dan sungguh jika mereka diperangi, niscaya me-reka tiada akan menolongnya, sungguh jika mereka menolongnya, niscaya mereka akan berpaling lari ke belakang, kemudian mereka tiada akan mendapat pertolongan. Sesungguhnya kamu dalam hati mereka lebih ditakuti daripada Allah. Yang demikian itu ka-rena mereka adalah kaum yang tiada mengerti. Mereka tiada akan memerangi kamu dalam keadaan bersatu padu, kecuali dalam kampung-kampung yang berbenteng atau di balik tembok. Per-musuhan antara sesama mereka adalah sangat hebat.

Mereka adalah sekelompok besar dari Yahudi yang bermukim di pinggiran kota Madinah pada saat Nabi a diutus. Ketika Nabi a diutus dan ber-hijrah ke Madinah, mereka kafir terhadap beliau seperti kufurnya sebagian besar kalangan Yahudi. Tujuh bulan seusai perang Badar, Rasulullah a mendatangi dan berbicara dengan mereka supaya mereka mau membantu menanggung denda pembunuhan orang-orang Kilabi yang dibunuh oleh Amr bin Umaiyah adh-Dhamri, mereka berkata, \"Kami akan melakukannya wahai Abu Qasim! Silahkan duduk di sini, biar kami bisa memenuhi keperluanmu.\" Kemudian mereka menepi satu sama lain <span class=\"green\">(saling berbisik-bisik)</span> dan setan pun membisikkan kesengsaraan yang telah ditakdirkan atas mereka. Mereka berencana membunuh Rasulullah a. Mereka berkata, \"Siapa yang mau mengambil alat penggiling gandum ini dan dibawa naik ke atas lalu ditimpakan di atas kepala Muhammad hingga pecah?\" Amr bin Jahhasy, orang yang paling celaka di an-tara mereka, berkata, \"Aku.\" Sallan bin Misykam berkata padanya, \"Jangan kau lakukan, demi Allah, niat kalian ini akan diberitahu-kan padanya dan hal ini bisa membatalkan perjanjian antara kita dengannya.\"\nWahyu langsung datang kepada Rasulullah a dari Rabbnya memberitahukan niat jahat yang akan dilakukan pada beliau, ke-mudian Rasulullah a langsung pergi menuju Madinah dan ber-temu dengan para sahabat. Para sahabat berkata, \"Anda pergi tapi kami tidak mengetahui kepergian Anda.\" Rasulullah a kemudian memberitahukan niat buruk kaum Yahudi yang akan dilakukan pada beliau. Rasulullah a kemudian mengirim para sahabat untuk mengusir kaum Yahudi dari Madinah seraya bersabda, \"Jangan biarkan mereka menempati Madinah bersamaku, mereka telah kuberi tempo selama sepuluh bulan, siapa pun yang aku temui setelah <span class=\"green\">(pengusiran)</span> ini, akan aku tebas lehernya.\" Para sahabat pun melakukan persiapan penyerangan selama berhari-hari. Si munafik Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul mengirim utusan untuk menemui orang-orang Yahudi seraya menyampaikan, \"Jangan tinggalkan Madinah, karena aku memiliki pasukan sejumlah dua ribu orang yang akan membela kalian dan rela mati demi kalian. Bani Qurai-dhah dan sekutu kalian dari kalangan Ghathafan akan menolong kalian.\" Pemimpin mereka, Huyay bin Akhtab amat mengingin-kan pesan yang disampaikan padanya, selanjutnya mendatangi Rasulullah a seraya berkata, \"Sesungguhnya kami tidak akan keluar dari tempat kami, silahkan kamu berbuat apa saja semau kamu.\" Rasulullah a pun bertakbir yang kemudian diikuti oleh para sahabat. Mereka pun pergi mendatangi kaum Yahudi, Ali bin Abi Thalib yang membawa bendera. Mereka berdiri di dekat ben-teng mereka dengan melempari tombak dan batu. Bani Quraidhah pun meninggalkan kaum Yahudi dan Abdullah bin Ubai serta sekutunya dari kalangan Ghathafan juga berkhianat. Rasulullah a lalu mengepung mereka dan menebang serta membakar pohon-pohon kurma mereka. Kaum Yahudi kemudian mengirim utusan menyampaikan pesan, \"Kami akan keluar meninggalkan Madinah.\" Maka beliau memutuskan agar mereka keluar darinya dengan hanya membawa diri mereka, anak-anak mereka, dan apa yang mampu dibawa oleh unta-unta mereka, kecuali senjata. Dan Rasulullah a menahan harta dan senjata mereka yang tersisa.\nHarta fai` dari Bani Nadhir murni untuk Rasulullah a, para petugas yang beliau tetapkan, dan kepentingan-kepentingan kaum Muslimin. Rasulullah a tidak membagikan harta rampasan Bani Nadhir, karena Allah سبحانه وتعالى telah memberikan harta rampasan perang Bani Nadhir kepada Rasulullah a dan kaum Muslimin tanpa menyerang Bani Nadhir dengan kuda maupun tunggangan lain. Mereka diusir ke Khaibar dan di kalangan mereka terdapat Huyay bin Akhtab pemimpin mereka. Beliau kemudian menguasai tanah dan kawasan mereka. Rasulullah a menahan persenjataan mereka. Jumlah senjata yang didapatkan sejumlah lima puluh baju besi, lima puluh topi besi dan tiga ratus empat puluh pedang. Inilah ringkasan kisahnya sebagaimana yang disebutkan oleh ahli sejarah.<span class=\"brown\">[114]</span>\n</div><div lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">\n<span class=\"green\">(1)</span> Allah سبحانه وتعالى memulai surat ini dengan mengabarkan bahwa semua yang ada di langit dan di bumi bertasbih memuji Rabbnya dan memahasucikanNya dari segala sesuatu yang tidak layak bagi keluhuranNya. Semua yang ada di langit dan di bumi menyembah dan tunduk pada keagunganNya, karena Dia Mahaperkasa yang memaksa segala sesuatu. Tidak ada sesuatu pun yang bisa meng-halangiNya. Semua makhluk yang sulit tunduk tidak ada yang bisa durhaka padaNya. Mahabijaksana dalam ciptaan serta urusanNya. Tidak menciptakan sesuatu pun dengan sia-sia. Tidak mensyariat-kan sesuatu pun yang tidak ada maslahatnya dan tidak melakukan apa pun kecuali berdasarkan hikmahNya.                </div><div lang=\"ms\" class=\"ms \">\n<span class=\"green\">(2)</span> Dan di antaranya adalah pertolongan Allah سبحانه وتعالى bagi Ra-sulNya a terhadap orang-orang kafir dari Ahli Kitab Bani Nadhir ketika mereka ingkar janji terhadap Rasulullah a, maka Allah سبحانه وتعالى mengusir mereka dari tempat tinggal dan tanah air yang mereka cintai.\nDan pengusiran ini adalah awal pengusiran dan eksodus yang telah Allah سبحانه وتعالى tetapkan melalui tangan RasulNya, Muhammad a, sehingga mereka pun pergi ke Khaibar. Ayat yang mulia ini menunjukkan bahwa akan ada pengusiran lain bagi mereka selain pengusiran tersebut, dan sungguh telah terjadi ketika Nabi a mengusir mereka dari Khaibar, kemudian Umar  رضي الله عنه juga mengusir yang tersisa dari mereka darinya.\n﴾ مَا  ظَنَنتُمۡ <span class=\"brown\">﴿   \"Kamu tiada menyangka\" wahai kaum Muslimin, ﴾</span> أَن  يَخۡرُجُواْۖ <span class=\"brown\">﴿   \"bahwa mereka akan keluar\" dari kampung-kampung mereka, karena <span class=\"green\">(adanya)</span> benteng-benteng, pertahanan, dan kekuatan <span class=\"green\">(yang mengitari mereka)</span>, ﴾</span> وَظَنُّوٓاْ  أَنَّهُم  مَّانِعَتُهُمۡ   حُصُونُهُم  مِّنَ  ٱللَّهِ <span class=\"brown\">﴿   \"dan mereka pun yakin, bahwa benteng-benteng mereka akan dapat mempertahankan me-reka dari <span class=\"green\">(siksaan)</span> Allah,\" mereka merasa kagum sehingga menipu daya mereka, dan mereka beranggapan bahwa mereka tidak akan terjangkau serta tidak ada seorang pun yang dapat merobohkan pertahanan mereka.\nNamun takdir Allah سبحانه وتعالى ada di balik semua itu, benteng-ben-teng itu tidak berguna, dan kekuatan serta pertahanan mereka pun tidak bermanfaat sama sekali. Oleh karena itu Allah سبحانه وتعالى berfirman, ﴾</span> فَأَتَىٰهُمُ  ٱللَّهُ  مِنۡ   حَيۡثُ  لَمۡ  يَحۡتَسِبُواْۖ <span class=\"brown\">﴿   \"Maka Allah mendatangkan kepada mereka <span class=\"green\">(hukuman)</span> dari arah yang tidak mereka sangka-sangka,\" maksudnya, dari perkara dan pintu yang tidak pernah sama sekali terbetik dalam benak mereka, di mana Allah سبحانه وتعالى  ﴾</span> وَقَذَفَ   فِي  قُلُوبِهِمُ  ٱلرُّعۡبَۚ <span class=\"brown\">﴿   \"men-campakkan ketakutan ke dalam hati mereka,\" yaitu ketakutan yang sangat, yang merupakan tentara Allah paling besar yang tidak dapat dikalahkan oleh banyaknya jumlah pasukan, perlengkapan perang, kekuatan maupun keperkasaan. Perkara yang mereka sangkakan, dan yang mereka yakini bahwasanya serangan akan menimpa mereka, jika memang dapat masuk, adalah melalui ben-teng-benteng yang mereka bertahan dengannya dan itulah yang mulanya membuat mereka tenang.\nNamun barangsiapa yang percaya kepada selain Allah, niscaya dia akan ditelantarkan, dan barangsiapa yang bersandar kepada selain Allah, maka bencanalah yang akan dia dapatkan. Datanglah kepada mereka perkara dari langit yang turun merasuki hati mereka yang merupakan tempat keteguhan dan kesabaran, atau sebaliknya tempat ketakutan dan kelemahan. Maka Allah سبحانه وتعالى menghilangkan kekuatan dan keperkasaannya, serta menaruhkan kelemahan dan ketakutan yang tidak ada kemampuan sedikitpun bagi mereka untuk menolaknya yang akan menjadi penolong bagi mereka. Oleh karena itu Dia سبحانه وتعالى berfirman, ﴾</span> يُخۡرِبُونَ  بُيُوتَهُم  بِأَيۡدِيهِمۡ  وَأَيۡدِي  ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ    <span class=\"brown\">﴿ \"Mereka memusnahkan rumah-rumah mereka dengan tangan mereka sendiri dan tangan orang-orang yang beriman.\" Yang demikian itu karena mereka telah bersepakat dengan Nabi a bahwa mereka di-bolehkan membawa barang-barang yang dapat dibawa oleh unta mereka, maka mereka mencabut bagian-bagian dari bangunan-bangunan rumah yang mereka anggap bagus, sehingga mereka menguasakan orang-orang yang beriman untuk merobohkan ru-mah-rumah mereka dan menghancurkan benteng-benteng mereka disebabkan kelaliman mereka sendiri.<span class=\"green\">(Jadi)</span> mereka sendirilah yang berbuat kesalahan atas diri mereka dan menjadi faktor terbesar untuk menghancurkan mereka.  ﴾</span> فَٱعۡتَبِرُواْ  يَٰٓأُوْلِي  ٱلۡأَبۡصَٰرِ ﴿   \"Maka ambillah <span class=\"green\">(kejadian itu)</span> untuk menjadi pela-jaran, hai orang-orang yang mempunyai pandangan,\" yakni, pandangan yang cerdas dan akal yang sempurna, karena sesungguhnya dalam hal ini terdapat pelajaran yang dengannya dapat diketahui per-buatan Allah سبحانه وتعالى kepada orang-orang yang menentang kebenaran lagi mengikuti hawa nafsu, yaitu orang-orang yang keperkasaan, kekuatan, benteng-benteng mereka, pertahanan maupun perlin-dungan kepada mereka, tidak dapat memberikan manfaat, tatkala datang perkara Allah سبحانه وتعالى, sampailah kepada mereka siksaan yang disebabkan oleh dosa-dosa mereka sendiri. Dan yang dijadikan sebagai sandaran adalah keumuman makna, bukan kekhususan sebab, sesungguhnya ayat ini menunjukkan adanya perintah un-tuk mengambil pelajaran, yaitu pelajaran bagi orang yang memiliki pandangan dengan pandangannya, mengqiyaskan sesuatu dengan sesuatu yang menyerupainya dan memikirkan apa yang terkan-dung dalam hukum-hukum berupa makna-makna dan hikmah yang merupakan tempat akal dan pikiran. Dengan demikian akal dapat sempurna, pandangan bercahaya, iman bertambah, dan tercapailah pemahaman yang hakiki.                </div><div lang=\"ms\" class=\"ms \">\n<span class=\"green\">(3)</span> Kemudian Allah تعالى mengabarkan kepada kita bahwa-sanya orang-orang Yahudi tidak mendapatkan semua hukuman yang menjadi hak mereka, dan bahwasanya Allah سبحانه وتعالى telah meri-ngankannya atas mereka. Kalaulah bukan karena Allah سبحانه وتعالى telah menetapkan pengusiran yang mereka alami dan merupakan keten-tuan Allah سبحانه وتعالى yang tidak mungkin dirubah, niscaya mereka akan mendapatkan azab dan siksaan dunia yang lain. Akan tetapi, mes-kipun mereka luput dari azab pedih dunia, sesungguhnya mereka akan mendapatkan siksaan api neraka yang tidak ada yang menge-tahui kedahsyatannya melainkan hanya Allah سبحانه وتعالى. Tidaklah terbetik dalam benak mereka bahwa siksaan mereka telah selesai dan tidak ada sisa azab sedikitpun, namun apa yang telah Allah siapkan bagi mereka berupa azab di akhirat adalah lebih besar dan lebih mengerikan.                </div><div lang=\"ms\" class=\"ms \">\n<span class=\"green\">(4)</span> ﴾ ذَٰلِكَ  <span class=\"brown\">﴿ \"Yang demikian itu,\" adalah karena mereka ﴾</span> بِأَنَّهُمۡ  شَآقُّواْ  ٱللَّهَ  وَرَسُولَهُۥۖ <span class=\"brown\">﴿   \"menentang Allah dan RasulNya,\" mereka memusuhi, memerangi dan berbuat kemaksiatan kepada keduanya.

Allah berfirman, ﴾ وَمَآ  أَفَآءَ  ٱللَّهُ   عَلَىٰ  رَسُولِهِۦ  مِنۡهُمۡ  <span class=\"brown\">﴿ \"Dan apa saja harta rampasan <span class=\"green\">(fai`)</span> yang diberikan Allah kepada RasulNya <span class=\"green\">(dari harta benda)</span> mereka,\" maksudnya dari penduduk kampung ini, yaitu Bani Nadhir, ﴾</span> فَـ<span class=\"brown\">﴿ \"maka,\" sesungguhnya kalian wahai kaum Muslimin ﴾</span> م آ     أَوۡجَفۡتُمۡ  عَلَيۡهِ  مِنۡ  خَيۡلٖ  وَلَا    رِكَابٖ   <span class=\"brown\">﴿ \"tidak mengerahkan seekor kuda pun dan <span class=\"green\">(tidak pula)</span> seekor unta pun,\" maksudnya, kalian tidak mendatangkan ataupun mengumpulkan itu semua, artinya, kalian tidak lelah untuk men-dapatkannya, tidak mengerahkan jiwa raga kalian dan tidak juga kendaraan-kendaraan kalian, akan tetapi Allah سبحانه وتعالى memasukkan rasa takut ke dalam hati mereka, sehingga harta benda tersebut mendatangi kalian dengan sangat mudahnya. Oleh karena itu Allah سبحانه وتعالى berfirman, ﴾</span> وَلَٰكِنَّ  ٱللَّهَ  يُسَلِّطُ  رُسُلَهُۥ  عَلَىٰ  مَن  يَشَآءُۚ       وَٱللَّهُ  عَلَىٰ  كُلِّ  شَيۡءٖ   قَدِيرٞ  ﴿ \"Tetapi Allah yang memberikan kekuasaan kepada RasulNya terhadap siapa yang dike-hendakiNya. Dan Allah Mahakuasa atas segala sesuatu.\" Merupakan kesempurnaan Kuasa Allah سبحانه وتعالى, bahwasanya tidak ada sesuatu pun yang dapat menahannya dan tidak ada satu kekuatan pun yang berharga selain dariNya.                </div><div lang=\"ms\" class=\"ms \">\n<span class=\"green\">(7)</span> Sedangkan pengertian اَلْفَيْءُ <span class=\"green\">(harta fai`)</span> dalam istilah para ulama fikih, adalah harta orang-orang kafir yang diambil secara hak tanpa adanya peperangan, seperti halnya dengan harta-harta tersebut yang mereka tinggalkan karena takut kepada orang-orang Islam. Dinamakan Fai` karena harta tersebut kembali dari orang-orang kafir yang tidak berhak memilikinya, kepada orang-orang Islam yang lebih berhak memilikinya. \nDan hukum harta fai` yang bersifat umum adalah sebagai-mana disebutkan dalam FirmanNya, ﴾ مَّآ  أَفَآءَ  ٱللَّهُ  عَلَىٰ  رَسُولِهِۦ  مِنۡ  أَهۡلِ  ٱلۡقُرَىٰ  <span class=\"brown\">﴿ \"Apa saja harta rampasan <span class=\"green\">(fai`)</span> yang diberikan Allah kepada RasulNya yang berasal dari penduduk kota-kota,\" secara umum, baik yang ada di masa Rasulullah a maupun setelahnya bagi pemimpin yang ber-kuasa dari kalangan umatnya sepeninggalnya,﴾</span> فَلِلَّهِ  وَلِلرَّسُولِ   وَلِذِي  ٱلۡقُرۡبَىٰ   وَٱلۡيَتَٰمَىٰ  وَٱلۡمَسَٰكِينِ  وَٱبۡنِ  ٱلسَّبِيلِ  <span class=\"brown\">﴿ \"maka adalah untuk Allah, Rasul, kerabat Rasul, anak-anak yatim, orang-orang miskin, dan ibnu sabil.\" Ayat ini serupa dengan ayat lain yang terdapat dalam Surat al-Anfal. Yaitu Firman Allah سبحانه وتعالى, \n﴾</span>  وَٱعۡلَمُوٓاْ  أَنَّمَا  غَنِمۡتُم  مِّن  شَيۡءٖ  فَأَنَّ  لِلَّهِ  خُمُسَهُۥ  وَلِلرَّسُولِ   وَلِذِي  ٱلۡقُرۡبَىٰ  وَٱلۡيَتَٰمَىٰ  وَٱلۡمَسَٰكِينِ  وَٱبۡنِ  ٱلسَّبِيلِ  <span class=\"brown\">﴿\n\"Ketahuilah, sesungguhnya apa saja yang dapat kamu peroleh seba-gai rampasan perang, maka sesungguhnya seperlima untuk Allah, Rasul, kerabat Rasul, anak-anak yatim, orang-orang miskin, dan Ibnu sabil.\" <span class=\"green\">(Al-<span class=\"blue\">Anfal:</span> 41)</span>.\nHarta rampasan fai` ini dibagi untuk lima bagian; untuk Allah سبحانه وتعالى dan Rasulullah a yang dialokasikan untuk keperluan kaum Muslimin secara umum, satu bagian lainnya untuk kerabat me-reka yaitu Bani Hasyim dan Bani Muththalib di mana saja mereka berada, bagian pihak lelaki sama seperti bagian pihak perempuan. Adanya Bani Muththalib masuk dalam salah satu dari lima bagian ini bersama Bani Hasyim tanpa memasukkan Bani Abdi Manaf lainnya adalah karena mereka, Bani Muththalib bersama-sama de-ngan Bani Hasyim termasuk satu golongan ketika kaum Quraisy sepakat untuk memblokade dan memusuhi mereka, dan mereka bersatu padu menolong Rasulullah a, tidak seperti Bani Manaf lainnya. Karena itu Rasulullah a bersabda tentang Bani Abdul Muththalib,<span class=\"brown\">[115]</span> \nإِنَّهُمْ لَمْ يُفَارِقُوْنِيْ فِيْ جَاهِلِيَّةٍ وَلَا إِسْلَامٍ.\n\"Sesungguhnya mereka tidak meninggalkanku pada saat jahiliyah maupun di masa Islam.\"<span class=\"brown\">[116]</span> \nSatu bagian lainnya diberikan untuk anak-anak yatim yang miskin. Anak yatim adalah anak yang ditinggalkan oleh ayahnya pada saat belum mencapai usia baligh. Satu bagian lainnya untuk orang-orang miskin. Satu bagian sisanya untuk ibnu sabil. Ibnu Sabil adalah orang-orang asing yang kehabisan bekal ketika berada di daerah orang lain.\nAllah سبحانه وتعالى menetapkan ketentuan tersebut dan hanya mem-batasi harta rampasan fai` untuk golongan-golongan yang telah ditentukan itu adalah agar ﴾</span> لَا    يَكُونَ   دُولَةَۢ  <span class=\"brown\">﴿ \"supaya harta itu jangan hanya beredar,\" yakni beredar dan menjadi kekhususan ﴾</span> بَيۡنَ  ٱلۡأَغۡنِيَآءِ  مِنكُمۡۚ <span class=\"brown\">﴿   \"di antara orang-orang kaya saja di antara kamu.\" Sebab andai Allah سبحانه وتعالى tidak menetapkan ketentuan di atas, tentu hanya orang-orang kaya saja yang akan memutarkan uang dan orang-orang lemah tidak akan mendapatkan sedikit pun, yang mana hal itu akan menimbul-kan kerusakan yang hanya diketahui oleh Allah سبحانه وتعالى. Sebagaimana dalam mengikuti perintah dan syariat Allah سبحانه وتعالى yang tidak termasuk dalam pembatasan di atas juga termasuk maslahat. Karena itulah Allah سبحانه وتعالى memerintahkan dengan kaidah menyeluruh dan pokok yang bersifat umum. Allah سبحانه وتعالى berfirman, ﴾</span> وَمَآ  ءَاتَىٰكُمُ  ٱلرَّسُولُ  فَخُذُوهُ  وَمَا   نَهَىٰكُمۡ    عَنۡهُ  فَٱنتَهُواْۚ <span class=\"brown\">﴿     \"Apa yang diberikan Rasul kepadamu, maka terimalah ia dan apa yang dilarangnya bagimu, maka tinggalkanlah.\" Ini mencakup pokok-pokok agama dan cabang-cabangnya, baik yang lahir mau-pun yang batin. Syariat yang dibawa oleh Rasulullah a harus dilaksanakan dan diikuti. Tidak boleh mengedepankan perkataan orang lain dari sabda beliau. Kemudian Allah سبحانه وتعالى memerintahkan untuk bertakwa, yang dengannya hati, ruh, dunia, dan akhirat akan tegak. Dengan takwa akan diperoleh kebahagiaan abadi dan keberuntungan yang besar. Dan menyia-nyiakan takwa akan mengundang kesengsaraan dan siksaan abadi. Allah سبحانه وتعالى berfirman, ﴾</span> وَٱتَّقُواْ  ٱللَّهَۖ       إِنَّ     ٱللَّهَ  شَدِيدُ  ٱلۡعِقَابِ ﴿   \"Dan bertakwalah kepada Allah. Sesungguhnya Allah sangat keras siksaNya\" bagi siapa saja yang tidak bertakwa dan lebih mengedepankan hawa nafsu.                </div><div lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">\n<span class=\"green\">(8-9)</span> Allah سبحانه وتعالى kemudian menjelaskan hikmah dan sebab yang mengharuskan Allah سبحانه وتعالى memberikan harta rampasan perang untuk golongan-golongan yang ditetapkan tersebut, karena me-reka adalah orang-orang yang berhak mendapatkan pertolongan, berhak mendapatkan bagian tersebut, dan harus disegerakan untuk diberikan pada mereka. Mereka berada di antara dua hijrah. Pertama, mereka telah meninggalkan semua yang dicintai seperti rumah, negeri, orang-orang tercinta, kekasih, dan harta demi Allah dan demi menolong Agama Allah سبحانه وتعالى dan mencintai Rasulullah a. Mereka adalah orang-orang yang benar, yang berbuat sebagaimana tuntutan keimanan. Mereka membuktikan keimanan dengan amal baik serta ibadah-ibadah berat. Lain halnya orang yang mengaku beriman tapi tidak dibuktikan dengan berjihad dan berhijrah serta ibadah-ibadah lainnya. \nKedua, mereka berada di kalangan kaum Anshar, Aus dan Khazraj, mereka adalah kaum yang beriman kepada Allah سبحانه وتعالى dan RasulNya secara taat dan suka rela. Mereka memberikan tempat berlindung untuk Rasulullah a yang tidak mereka berikan pada kaum bangsawan maupun rakyat. Mereka menempati negeri hijrah dan iman hingga menjadi tempat orang-orang Mukmin dan kaum Muhajirin berlindung serta menjadi kediaman kaum Mus-limin dalam penjagaannya pada saat seluruh negeri adalah negeri harbi <span class=\"green\">(perang)</span>, syirik, dan buruk. Para penolong Agama senantiasa berlindung ke kaum Anshar, hingga Islam menyebar dan kuat serta bertambah dan berkembang sedikit demi sedikit hingga mereka mampu membuka hati manusia dengan ilmu, iman, dan al-Qur`an, serta mampu menaklukkan berbagai negeri dengan senjata. \nDi antara sebagian besar sifat orang-orang yang disinggung ini a d a l a h     ﴾ يُحِبُّونَ  مَنۡ  هَاجَرَ  إِلَيۡهِمۡ <span class=\"brown\">﴿   \"mereka mencintai orang yang berhijrah kepada mereka,\" karena kecintaan mereka kepada Allah سبحانه وتعالى dan RasulNya, mereka mencintai orang-orang yang mencintaiNya dan menolong AgamaNya, ﴾</span> وَلَا   يَجِدُونَ  فِي  صُدُورِهِمۡ  حَاجَةٗ   مِّمَّآ  أُوتُواْ <span class=\"brown\">﴿   \"dan mereka tiada menaruh keinginan dalam hati mereka terhadap apa-apa yang di-berikan kepada mereka <span class=\"green\">(orang Muhajirin)</span>,\" maksudnya, mereka tidak menaruh sikap hasad terhadap kaum Muhajirin atas karunia yang diberikan Allah سبحانه وتعالى serta berbagai keutamaan dan sifat baik yang berhak mereka miliki.\nIni menunjukkan bersihnya hati mereka dari sifat dengki, iri, dan hasad. Dan juga menunjukkan bahwa kaum Muhajirin lebih utama dari kaum Anshar, karena Allah سبحانه وتعالى terlebih dahulu menye-but kaum Muhajirin sebelum kaun Anshar. Allah سبحانه وتعالى juga menga-barkan bahwa kaum Anshar tidak menaruh keinginan dalam hati mereka terhadap apa pun yang diberikan Allah سبحانه وتعالى pada kaum Muhajirin. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa Allah سبحانه وتعالى memberi mereka karunia yang tidak diberikan pada kaum Anshar dan juga pada yang lainnya, karena mereka menyatukan antara menolong Agama Allah سبحانه وتعالى dan hijrah. \nFirman Allah سبحانه وتعالى, ﴾</span> وَيُؤۡثِرُونَ  عَلَىٰٓ  أَنفُسِهِمۡ  وَلَوۡ   كَانَ     بِهِمۡ    خَصَاصَةٞۚ <span class=\"brown\">﴿   \"Dan mereka mengutamakan <span class=\"green\">(orang-orang Muhajirin)</span>, atas diri mereka sendiri. Seka-lipun mereka memerlukan <span class=\"green\">(apa yang mereka berikan itu)</span>.\" Maksudnya, di antara sifat-sifat kaum Anshar yang tidak bisa disaingi oleh yang lain dan menjadi karakteristik utama mereka adalah lebih mengutamakan orang lain daripada dirinya sendiri. Sifat ini me-rupakan puncak berbagai jenis kedermaan. Yaitu mengutamakan orang lain daripada diri sendiri, baik dalam hal harta maupun yang lainnya, padahal sebenarnya mereka juga memerlukannya bahkan sekalipun mereka amat memerlukannya. Sifat seperti altruisme <span class=\"green\">(mengutamakan kepentingan orang lain)</span> ini hanya dimiliki oleh orang yang mempunyai akhlak yang suci dan lebih mencintai Allah سبحانه وتعالى daripada mencintai keinginan diri dan berbagai kenik-matannya. \nDi antaranya adalah kisah seorang Anshar<span class=\"brown\">[117]</span> yang menjadi penyebab turunnya ayat ini ketika lebih mengutamakan tamunya dengan memberinya makanan sementara rela membiarkan diri dan keluarganya tidur dalam keadaan lapar.\nKebalikan dari altruisme adalah egoisme. Altruisme adalah sifat terpuji sedangkan egoisme adalah sifat tercela, karena terma-suk sifat-sifat kikir dan pelit. Siapa pun yang diberi karunia sifat altruisme, maka telah terjaga dari kekikiran diri.﴾</span> وَمَن  يُوقَ  شُحَّ  نَفۡسِهِۦ  فَأُوْلَٰٓئِكَ  هُمُ  ٱلۡمُفۡلِحُونَ ﴿   \"Dan siapa yang dipelihara dari kekikiran dirinya, mereka itulah orang-orang yang beruntung.\" Menjaga kekikiran diri mencakup menjaga diri dari kekikiran dalam seluruh hal yang di-perintahkan. Sebab jika seorang hamba telah terjaga dari kekikiran dirinya, maka ia merelakan dirinya untuk menunaikan segala perintah Allah سبحانه وتعالى dan RasulNya. Pekerjaan yang dilakukan semata karena ketaatan dan ketundukan dengan kelapangan dada serta merelakan dirinya untuk menjauhi larangan Allah سبحانه وتعالى meskipun disenangi oleh jiwa, meski jiwanya menyeru dan ingin melaku-kannya. Orang yang terjaga dari kekikiran diri juga merelakan diri untuk mencurahkan harta di jalan Allah سبحانه وتعالى demi mencari keridha-anNya. Dengan demikian ia akan mendapatkan keberuntungan dan kemenangan. Lain halnya dengan orang yang tidak terjaga dari kekikiran dirinya. Bahkan diuji dengan bersifat kikir terhadap kebaikan yang justru menjadi pangkal dan asal-usul keburukan.                </div><div lang=\"ms\" class=\"ms \">\n<span class=\"green\">(1 0 0 )</span> Kedua golongan mulia dan suci di atas adalah para sahabat yang mulia dan para imam bagi orang-orang utama. Me-reka adalah sosok yang telah meraih predikat sebagai yang terde-pan, nilai-nilai keutamaan dan sifat baik yang tidak bisa disaingi oleh orang-orang setelah mereka dan belum pernah didapat oleh orang-orang sebelum mereka. Mereka pun menjadi para pemimpin kaum Mukminin, Muslimin dan orang-orang bertakwa. Cukuplah bagi generasi setelah mereka mendapatkan kebaikan dengan ber-jalan di belakang mereka dan menjadikan petunjuk mereka sebagai pemimpin. Karena itulah Allah سبحانه وتعالى menyebut generasi-generasi setelah mereka, yaitu orang-orang yang mengikuti mereka dan seluruh orang yang ada setelah mereka seraya berfirman, ﴾ وَٱلَّذِينَ  جَآءُو  مِنۢ  بَعۡدِهِمۡ <span class=\"brown\">﴿   \"Dan orang-orang yang datang sesudah mereka,\" yakni setelah kaum Muhajirin dan Anshar, ﴾</span> يَقُولُونَ <span class=\"brown\">﴿   \"mereka berdoa,\" memberi nasihat untuk diri mereka sendiri dan seluruh kaum Muslimin, ﴾</span> رَبَّنَا  ٱغۡفِرۡ      لَنَا     وَلِإِخۡوَٰنِنَا  ٱلَّذِينَ  سَبَقُونَا  بِٱلۡإِيمَٰنِ <span class=\"brown\">﴿   \"Ya Rabb kami, beri ampunlah kami dan saudara-saudara kami yang telah beriman lebih da-hulu dari kami.\" Doa ini mencakup seluruh kaum Mukminin dari kalangan sahabat pendahulu dan orang-orang sebelum dan sesu-dah mereka. \nInilah di antara salah satu keutamaan iman. Orang-orang Mukmin itu saling memberi manfaat bagi sesama dan saling men-doakan satu sama lain karena kebersamaan mereka dalam iman yang mengharuskan adanya ikatan persaudaraan di antara kaum Mukminin yang di antaranya adalah dengan saling mendoakan satu sama lain dan saling mencintai satu sama lain. Karena itu, dalam doa ini Allah سبحانه وتعالى menafikan sifat dengki dari hati orang-orang yang beriman, baik yang sedikit maupun yang banyak. Karena sifat dengki tidak ada di hati, maka yang ada adalah kebalikannya, yaitu sifat saling mencintai, saling memberi pertolongan, nasihat dan lainnya untuk sesama Mukmin yang termasuk hak-hak orang yang beriman. \nAllah سبحانه وتعالى menyifati generasi-generasi setelah sahabat dengan keimanan, sebab perkataan orang-orang Mukmin itu, ﴾</span> سَبَقُونَا  بِٱلۡإِيمَٰنِ ﴿   \"dan saudara-saudara kami yang telah beriman lebih dahulu dari kami,\" adalah dalil atas kebersamaan mereka dalam keimanan. Mereka adalah para pengikut sahabat dalam kaidah dan pondasi keimanan. Mereka adalah Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama'ah di mana sifat sempurna ini hanya terwujud pada mereka. Allah سبحانه وتعالى juga menyebutkan sifat mereka dengan mengakui dosa-dosa serta meminta ampunan dari dosa-dosa serta saling memintakan ampunan satu sama lain serta usaha keras mereka untuk melenyapkan sifat dengki dan iri dari hati mereka terhadap sesama saudara seiman. Sebab doa mereka mengharuskan hal-hal yang telah kami sebut di atas yang men-cakup rasa saling mencintai satu sama lain, mencintai orang lain seperti mencintai diri sendiri dan memberi nasihat pada orang lain, baik ketika saudaranya ada, tidak ada, masih hidup atau sudah mati.\nAyat ini menunjukkan bahwa saling mendoakan satu sama lain adalah di antara salah satu hak kaum Mukminin. Kemudian doa mereka diakhiri dengan dua nama mulia yang menunjukkan sempurnanya rahmat Allah سبحانه وتعالى dan sempurnanya kasih sayang serta kebaikanNya terhadap kaum Mukminin yang di antaranya <span class=\"green\">(bahkan termasuk yang paling agung)</span> adalah memberi taufik pada kaum Mukminin untuk saling menunaikan hak sesama dan hak-hak hamba Allah سبحانه وتعالى.\nKetiga golongan tersebut adalah golongan umat ini yang ber-hak mendapatkan harta rampasan perang yang alokasinya meru-juk pada maslahat Islam. Mereka adalah kaum Muslimin dan ahli Islam. Semoga kita semua dimasukkan Allah سبحانه وتعالى dalam golongan mereka berkat karunia dan kemuliaanNya.                </div><div lang=\"ms\" class=\"ms \">\n<span class=\"green\">(11)</span> Kemudian Allah سبحانه وتعالى heran terhadap kondisi kaum mu-nafik yang condong memberikan pertolongan dan loyalitas pada saudara-saudara mereka dari kalangan Ahli Kitab daripada me-nolong saudara-saudara mereka dari kalangan kaum Mukminin. Orang-orang munafik berkata pada orang-orang Yahudi, ﴾ لَئِنۡ  أُخۡرِجۡتُمۡ   لَنَخۡرُجَنَّ  مَعَكُمۡ  وَلَا  نُطِيعُ  فِيكُمۡ      أَحَدًا  أَبَدٗا  <span class=\"brown\">﴿ \"Sesungguhnya jika kamu diusir, niscaya kami pun akan keluar bersama kamu; dan kami selama-lamanya tidak akan patuh kepada siapa pun untuk <span class=\"green\">(menyusahkan)</span> kamu,\" maksudnya, kami tidak akan menaati orang yang tidak memberi pertolongan pada kalian yang akan merendahkan dan menakutkan kami. ﴾</span> وَإِن  قُوتِلۡتُمۡ  لَنَنصُرَنَّكُمۡ  وَٱللَّهُ  يَشۡهَدُ  إِنَّهُمۡ  لَكَٰذِبُونَ  ﴿ \"Dan jika kamu diperangi, pasti kami akan membantu kamu.' Dan Allah menyaksikan, bahwa sesungguhnya mereka benar-benar pendusta\" dalam janji ini yang membuat teman-teman mereka terpedaya, tidak lebih dari itu karena berdusta adalah sifat mereka.

Sehingga mereka akan saling menolong satu sama lain untuk kemaslahatan dan kepentingan mereka, baik dalam urusan dunia maupun akhirat. Hingga mereka pun seperti layaknya orang-orang yang mendapatkan kehinaan dari kalangan ahli kitab, orang-orang yang dikalahkan oleh Allah سبحانه وتعالى melalui tangan utusanNya hingga mereka mengenyam kehinaan dalam kehidupan dunia dan tidak memberikan pertolongan pada orang yang mereka janjikan akan ditolong.                </div><div lang=\"ms\" class=\"ms \">\n<span class=\"green\">(15)</span>  ﴾ كَمَثَلِ  ٱلَّذِينَ  مِن  قَبۡلِهِمۡ   قَرِيبٗاۖ <span class=\"brown\">﴿   \"<span class=\"green\">(Mereka adalah)</span> seperti orang-orang Yahudi yang belum lama sebelum mereka,\" yakni kaum kafir Quraisy yang \n﴾</span> زَيَّنَ  لَهُمُ   ٱلشَّيۡطَٰنُ  أَعۡمَٰلَهُمۡ وَقَالَ     لَا غَالِبَ     لَكُمُ  ٱلۡيَوۡمَ  مِنَ   ٱلنَّاسِ  وَإِنِّي جَارٞ  لَّكُمۡۖ       فَلَمَّا  تَرَآءَتِ  ٱلۡفِئَتَانِ  نَكَصَ   عَلَىٰ  عَقِبَيۡهِ  وَقَالَ  إِنِّي    بَرِيٓءٞ  مِّنكُمۡ  إِنِّيٓ    أَرَىٰ  مَا  لَا  تَرَوۡنَ <span class=\"brown\">﴿ \n\"Ketika setan menjadikan mereka memandang baik pekerjaan mereka dan mengatakan, 'Tidak ada seorang manusia pun yang dapat menang terhadap kamu pada hari ini, dan sesungguhnya saya ini adalah pelin-dungmu.'

وقت بعثة النبي - صلى الله عليه وسلم -، فلمَّا بُعث النبيُّ - صلى الله عليه وسلم - وهاجر إلى المدينة؛ كفروا به في جملة من كفر من اليهود، فهادن النبيُّ - صلى الله عليه وسلم - طوائف اليهود الذين هم جيرانه في المدينة، فلما كان بعد وقعةِ بدرٍ بستة أشهر أو نحوها؛ خرج إليهم النبيُّ - صلى الله عليه وسلم -، وكلَّمهم أن يعينوه في دِيَةِ الكلابيين الذين قتلهم عمرو بن أمية الضَّمْريُّ،<span class=\"blue\"> فقالوا:</span> نفعل يا أبا القاسم! اجلس هاهنا حتى نقضي حاجتك! فخلا بعضهم ببعض، وسوَّل لهم الشيطانُ الشقاء الذي كُتِبَ عليهم، فتآمروا بقتله - صلى الله عليه وسلم -،<span class=\"blue\"> فقالوا:</span> أيُّكم يأخُذُ هذه الرحى فيصعد  فيلقيها على رأسه يشدخه بها؟<span class=\"blue\"> فقال أشقاهم عمرو بن جحاش:</span> أنا.<span class=\"blue\"> فقال لهم سلامُ بن مشكمٍ:</span> لا تفعلوا؛ فوالله؛ لَيُخْبَرَنَّ بما هممتم به، وإنَّه لنقضٌ للعهد الذي بيننا وبينه.\nوجاء الوحي على الفور إليه من ربِّه بما همُّوا به، فنهض مسرعاً، فتوجَّه إلى المدينة، ولحقه أصحابُه،<span class=\"blue\"> فقالوا:</span> نهضتَ ولم نشعرْ بك! فأخبرهم بما همَّتْ يهودُ به، وبعث إليهم رسولُ الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - أنِ اخْرُجوا من المدينة ولا تساكنوني بها، وقد أجَّلْتُكم عشراً؛ فمن وجدتُ بعد ذلك؛ ضربتُ عُنُقه. فأقاموا أياماً يتجهَّزون، وأرسل إليهم المنافق عبد الله بن أبيِّ بن سلول أن لا تخرجوا من دياركم؛ فإن معي ألفين يدخلون معكم حصنكم فيموتون دونكم، وتنصُرُكم قريظةُ وحلفاؤكم من غطفان. وطمع رئيسهم حييُّ بن أخطبَ فيما قال له، وبعث إلى رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم -<span class=\"blue\"> يقول:</span> إنَّا لا نخرج من ديارنا؛ فاصنعْ ما بدا لك! فكبَّر رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - وأصحابه، ونهضوا إليهم، وعلي بن أبي طالب يحملُ اللواء، وأقاموا على حصونهم يرمون بالنَّبْل والحجارة، واعتزلتهم قريظةُ، وخانهم ابنُ أبيٍّ وحلفاؤهم من غطفان، فحاصرهم رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم -، وقطع نخلَهم وحرَّق،<span class=\"blue\"> فأرسلوا إليه:</span> نحن نخرجُ من المدينة، فأنزلهم على أن يخرجوا منها بنفوسهم وذراريِّهم وأنَّ لهم ما حملتْ إبِلُهم إلاَّ السلاحَ. وقبض رسولُ الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - الأموال والسلاح.\nوكانت بنو النضير خالصةً لرسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - لنوائبه ومصالح المسلمين، ولم يخمِّسْها؛ لأن الله أفاءها عليه ولم يوجِفِ المسلمون عليها بخيل ولا ركابٍ، وأجلاهم إلى خيبر، وفيهم حييُّ بن أخطب كبيرهم، واستولى على أرضهم وديارهم، وقبض السلاح، فوجد من السلاح خمسين درعاً وخمسين بيضةً وثلاثمائة وأربعين سيفاً، هذا حاصل قصتهم كما ذكرها أهل السير.                </div><div lang=\"ar\" class=\"ar \">\n<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">{1}</span> فافتتح تعالى هذه السورة بالإخبار أنَّ جميع مَن في السماوات والأرض تسبِّح بحمد ربِّها وتنزِّهه عمَّا لا يليق بجلاله وتعبُدُه وتخضعُ لعظمتِهِ ؛ لأنه العزيز الذي قد قهر كلَّ شيء؛ فلا يمتنعُ عليه شيءٌ، ولا يستعصي عليه عسيرٌ ، الحكيم في خلقِه وأمرِه؛ فلا يخلُقُ شيئاً عبثاً، ولا يُشْرِّعُ ما لا مصلحة فيه، ولا يفعل إلا ما هو مقتضى حكمته.                </div><div lang=\"ar\" class=\"ar \">\n<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">{2}</span> ومن ذلك نصرُه لرسوله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - على الذين كفروا من أهل الكتاب من بني النضير حين غَدَروا برسوله فأخرجهم من ديارهم وأوطانهم التي ألِفوها وأحبوها، وكان إخراجهم منها أولَ حشرٍ وجلاءٍ كتبه الله عليهم على يد رسولِه محمدٍ - صلى الله عليه وسلم -، فجلوا إلى خيبر. ودلَّت الآية الكريمة أن لهم حشراً وجلاءً غير هذا؛ فقد وقع حين أجلاهم النبيُّ - صلى الله عليه وسلم - من خيبر، ثم عمرُ رضي الله عنه أخرج بقيتهم منها. <span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">{ما ظننتُم}</span>: أيها المسلمون <span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">{أن يخرُجوا}</span>: من ديارهم؛ لحصانتها ومنعتها وعزِّهم فيها، <span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">{وظنوا أنهم مانعتُهم حصونُهم من اللهِ}</span>: فأعجبوا بها، وغرَّتْهم، وحسبوا أنهم لا يُنالون بها، ولا يقدِرُ عليها أحدٌ، وقدَرُ الله وراء ذلك كلِّه، لا تغني عنه الحصونُ والقلاعُ ولا تجدي فيه القوةُ والدفاع،<span class=\"blue\"> ولهذا قال:</span><span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">{فأتاهمُ اللهُ من حيثُ لم يحتسِبوا}</span>؛<span class=\"blue\"> أي:</span> من الأمر والباب الذي لم يخطر ببالهم أن يُؤتَوا منه،<span class=\"blue\"> وهو أنَّه تعالى:</span><span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">{قَذَفَ في قلوبِهِم الرعبَ}</span>: وهو الخوف الشديدُ، الذي هو جند الله الأكبر، الذي لا ينفع معه عددٌ ولا عدةٌ ولا قوةٌ ولا شدةٌ؛ فالأمر الذي يحتسبونه، ويظنُّون أنَّ الخلل يدخل عليهم منه إن دخل، هو الحصون التي تحصَّنوا بها واطمأنتْ نفوسُهم إليها، ومن وَثِقَ بغير الله؛ فهو مخذولٌ، ومن ركن إلى غير الله؛ كان وبالاً عليه ، فأتاهم أمرٌ سماويٌّ نزل على قلوبهم، التي هي محلُّ الثبات والصبر أو الخور والضعف، فأزال قوَّتها وشدَّتها، وأورثها ضعفاً وخوراً وجبناً لا حيلة لهم في دفعه ، فصار ذلك عوناً عليهم،<span class=\"blue\"> ولهذا قال:</span><span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">{يُخۡرِبونَ بيوتَهم بأيديهِم وأيدي المُؤمِنينَ}</span>، وذلك أنَّهم صالحوا النبيَّ - صلى الله عليه وسلم - على أنَّ لهم ما حملتِ الإبلُ، فنقضوا لذلك كثيراً من سقوفهم التي استحسنوها، وسلَّطوا المؤمنين بسبب بغيهم على إخراب ديارِهِم وهدم حصونِهم، فهم الذين جَنَوا على أنفسهم وصاروا أكبر عونٍ عليها. <span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">{فاعۡتَبِروا يا

لأهوائهم، الذين لم تنفعهم عزَّتهم ولا مَنَعَتْهم قوتُهم ولا حصَّنتهم حصونهم، حين جاءهم أمرُ الله؛ وصل إليهم النكال بذنوبهم، والعبرة بعموم المعنى لا بخصوص السبب؛ فإنَّ هذه الآية تدلُّ على الأمر بالاعتبار، وهو اعتبار النظير بنظيره، وقياس الشيء على ما يشابهه ، والتفكُّر فيما تضمَّنته الأحكام من المعاني والحكم التي هي محلُّ العقل والفكرة، وبذلك يكمُلُ العقل، وتتنور البصيرة، ويزداد الإيمان، ويحصل الفهم الحقيقيُّ.                </div><div lang=\"ar\" class=\"ar \">\n<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">{3}</span> ثم أخبر تعالى أنَّ هؤلاء اليهود لم يصِبْهم جميع ما يستحقون من العقوبة، وأن

class=\"brown\">[تعالى]</span> وأمره، <span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">{ولِيُخۡزِيَ الفاسقين}</span>: حيث سلَّطكم على قطع نخلهم وتحريقها؛ ليكون ذلك نكالاً لهم وخزياً في الدُّنيا وذلًّا يُعرف به

الذين لهم الحقُّ الأوفر فيه.<span class=\"blue\"> وحكمه العامُّ كما ذكره الله بقوله:</span><span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">{ما أفاءَ اللهُ على رسولهِ من أهلِ القُرى}</span>: عموماً، سواء كان في

وإناثهم، وإنَّما دخل بنو المطَّلب في خمس الخمس مع بني هاشم ولم يدخُلْ بقية بني عبد مناف؛ لأنهم شاركوا بني هاشم في دخولهم الشعبَ حين تعاقدتْ قريشٌ على هجرهم وعداوتهم، فنصروا رسولَ الله - صلى الله عليه

هجروا المحبوبات والمألوفات من الديار والأوطان والأحباب والخلان والأموال رغبةً في الله ونصرةً لدين الله ومحبةً لرسول الله؛ فهؤلاء هم الصادقون؛ الذين عملوا بمقتضى إيمانهم، وصدَّقوا إيمانَهم بأعمالهم الصالحة والعبادات الشاقَّة؛ بخلاف مَنِ ادَّعى الإيمان وهو لم يصدِّقْه بالجهاد والهجرة وغيرهما من العبادات، وبين أنصار، وهم الأوس والخزرج، الذين آمنوا بالله ورسوله طوعاً ومحبةً واختياراً، وآووا رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم -، ومنعوه من الأحمر والأسود، وتبوَّءوا دار الهجرة والإيمان، حتى صارت موئلاً ومرجعاً يرجع إليه المؤمنون، ويلجأ إليه المهاجرون، ويسكن بحماه المسلمون؛ إذ كانت البلدانُ كلُّها بلدانَ حربٍ وشركٍ وشرٍّ، فلم يزل أنصارُ الدين يأوون إلى الأنصار، حتى انتشر الإسلام وقوي وجعل يزداد  شيئاً فشيئاً، <span class=\"brown\">[وينمو قليلاً قليلاً]</span> حتى فتحوا القلوبَ بالعلم والإيمان

والمناقب الذين هم أهلها.\nوهذا يدلُّ على سلامة صدورهم وانتفاء الغلِّ والحقد والحسد عنها، ويدلُّ ذلك على أنَّ المهاجرين أفضل من الأنصار؛ لأنَّ الله قدَّمهم بالذِّكر، وأخبر أنَّ الأنصارَ لا يجدون في صدورهم حاجةً مما أوتوا، فدلَّ على أنَّ الله تعالى آتاهم ما لم يؤتِ الأنصارَ ولا غيرهم، ولأنَّهم جمعوا بين النصرة والهجرة،<span class=\"blue\"> وقوله:</span><span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs

بمحابِّ النفس من الأموال وغيرها، وبذلها للغيرِ، مع الحاجة إليها، بل مع الضَّرورة والخَصاصة، وهذا لا يكون إلا من خُلُقٍ زكيٍّ ومحبَّة لله تعالى مقدَّمة على <span class=\"brown\">[محبة]</span> شهوات النفس ولذَّاتها. ومن ذلك قصَّة الأنصاريِّ الذي نزلت الآية بسببه حين آثر ضيفَه بطعامه وطعام أهله وأولادِهِ وباتوا جياعاً.\nوالإيثار عكس الأثَرَةِ؛ فالإيثارُ محمودٌ، والأثَرَةُ مذمومةٌ؛ لأنَّها من خصال

وسمحتْ نفسه ببذل الأموال في سبيل الله وابتغاءِ مرضاتِه، وبذلك يحصُلُ الفلاح والفوزُ؛ بخلاف مَنْ لم يوقَ شحَّ نفسه، بل ابْتُلِيَ بالشُّحِّ بالخير الذي هو أصل الشرِّ ومادته.                </div><div

Так называлось крупное иу- дейское племя, жившее недалеко от Медины задолго до того, как Пророк Мухам- мад, ﷺ, начал свою пророческую миссию. Когда же он переселился в Медину, то это племя, как и многие другие иудейские племена, отказалось уверовать в Еди- ного Аллаха и Его посланника, ﷺ. Тогда он заключил мирный договор с иудея- ми, которые были соседями мусульман в Медине. Спустя шесть месяцев после битвы при Бадре Пророк приехал в поселения племени Надыр и попросил их по- мочь мусульманам заплатить выкуп за Амра б. Умейу ад-Дамри, который убил нескольких людей из племени аль-Киляб.<span class=\"blue\">\nИудеи сказали:</span><span class=\"brown\">«Мы поможем вам, Абу аль-Касым. Посиди здесь, пока мы не решим твой вопрос»</span>. Когда же они уединились для совместного принятия реше- ния, сатана подтолкнул их на тяжкое преступление, дабы обрушить на них пред- писанное им несчастье.<span class=\"blue\"> Они сговорились убить Пророка и сказали:</span><span class=\"brown\">«Кто возьмет этот камень и сбросит ее так, чтобы разбить ему голову?»</span> Несчастный грешник по имени Амр б. Джуххаш вызвался на это дело. Тогда Салам б.<span class=\"blue\"> Мишкам сказал:</span><span class=\"brown\">«Не делайте этого. Клянусь Аллахом, его оповестят о вашем заговоре, и тогда мы первыми разорвем заключенный с ним договор»</span>.\nГосподь тотчас ниспослал Пророку, ﷺ , откровение о планах иудеев. Пос- ланник Аллаха, ﷺ, встал и спешно отправился в Медину. Сподвижники дог-<span class=\"blue\">\nнали его и сказали:</span><span class=\"brown\">«Ты встал так, что мы даже не заметили этого»</span>. Он по- ведал им о заговоре иудеев,<span class=\"blue\"> а затем отправил к ним послание со следующим повелением:</span><span class=\"brown\">«Покиньте Медину и никогда более не поселяйтесь в ней. Я даю вам десять дней, и если обнаружу вас здесь по истечении этого срока, то от- рублю вам головы»</span>.\nВ течение нескольких дней иудеи готовились к переселению. Но затем один из лицемеров по имени Абдуллах б. Убей б. Салул отправил им письмо, в кото-<span class=\"blue\"> ром написал:</span><span class=\"brown\">«Не покидайте своих домов. У меня есть две тысячи человек, кото- рые готовы укрыться в вашей крепости и умереть за вас. Племя Курейза и ваши союзники из племени Гатфан также готовы помочь вам»</span>.\nСтарейшина племени Надыр Хуай б. Ахтаб понадеялся на обещанную ему поддержку и написал посланнику Аллаха, ﷺ,<span class=\"blue\"> следующее послание:</span><span class=\"brown\">«Мы не оста- вим своих домов, посему делай все, что тебе вздумается»</span>. Услышав об этом, пос- ланник Аллаха возвеличил Аллаха, а его сподвижники тотчас приготовились к\nсражению. Знамя мусульман понес Али б. Абу Талиб.\nИудеи обосновались в своих крепостях, отбиваясь камнями и стрелами. Курейзиты, сторонники Абдуллаха б. Убейа и союзники из Гатфана преда- тельски отвернулись от них. Посланник Аллаха, ﷺ, окружил поселения иуде- ев и приказал своим сподвижникам начать вырубать и сжигать их пальмовые\nдеревья. Осознав, в каком положении они оказались, иудеи написали Проро- ку, ﷺ, послание, в котором согласились покинуть Медину. Пророк, ﷺ, снял блокаду и позволил им собраться и уехать вместе со своими семьями и всем, что смогут унести их верблюды, кроме оружия. Так он овладел имуществом и оружием иудеев. Трофеи целиком достались Пророку, ﷺ , и были  предназна- чены для нужд мусульман.\nПророк, ﷺ, не стал делить военную добычу на пять частей, как это полагает- ся делать с трофеями, потому что Аллах даровал ему эту добычу без борьбы. Му- сульмане не седлали своих лошадей и не прилагали усилий для достижения по- беды. Пророк, ﷺ, изгнал иудеев в Хейбар вместе с их предводителем Хуайем б. Ахтабом. А мусульмане овладели их землями, жилищами и оружием. Среди тро- феев оказалось пятьдесят кольчуг, пятьдесят шлемов и триста сорок мечей.

Его творения и повеления преисполнены мудрости, поскольку Он ничего не творит ради забавы, ниспосылает только полезные предписания и вершит только то, чего требует Его божественная мудрость.                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(2)</span> Он даровал победу Своему посланнику, ﷺ, над неверующими людьми Писания и изгнал племя Надыр из облюбованных ими жилищ и мест за их вероломство и измену. Иудеи собрались и покинули Медину, но это было лишь первым сбором и изгнанием из тех, что им предстояло пережить при жизни Пророка Мухамма- да, ﷺ. Кораническое откровение указывало на то, что и в будущем иудеев ожида- ли сборы и изгнания. И это предсказание сбылось, когда сначала Пророк Мухам- мад, ﷺ, изгнал иудеев из Хейбара, а затем Умар б. аль-Хаттаб велел оставшимся иудеям покинуть земли этого поселения.\nО мусульмане! Вы даже не предполагали, что они уйдут из родных домов, по- тому что иудейские поселения были хорошо укреплены и неприступны, да и са- ми иудеи за крепостными стенами были довольно сильны. Они надеялись, что крепости защитят их от Аллаха, и полагались на собственную мощь. Они были обольщены собой и считали, что никто не сможет одолеть их. Но Аллах всемо- гущ и способен одолеть любое воинство. Ни крепости, ни башни не способны за- щитить людей от Него. В такой борьбе ни мощь, ни оборона не могут принести никакой пользы.\nВсевышний Аллах настиг их оттуда, откуда они и не ожидали, и поселил в их сердцах страх. Страх и ужас — это величайшее оружие Аллаха, которое нельзя одолеть ни числом, ни умением, ни мощью, ни силой. Иудеи предполагали, что брешью в их обороне могут стать крепости, за которыми они чувствовали себя спокойно. Всякий же, кто полагается на что-либо, помимо Аллаха, непременно лишится поддержки Господа. И всякий, кто предается кому-либо, помимо Алла- ха, лишь взваливает на свои плечи тяжелое бремя.\nПоэтому удар с небес поразил самое уязвимое место иудеев — их сердца. А ведь именно сердца являются местом, где покоятся стойкость и терпение, упа- док духа и слабость. И вот развеялись мощь и сила иудеев, а их место заняли сла- бость, отчаяние и трусость, от которых они уже не могли избавиться. Именно это стало причиной их поражения.\nИудеи сами разрушали свои дома и подстрекали к этому верующих. Они пос- тупали так, потому что посланник Аллаха, ﷺ, позволил им взять с собой лишь то, что смогут унести верблюды. Тогда они решили поломать крыши своих до- мов, которые некогда берегли и которыми любовались, и стали подстрекать ве-\nрующих к тому, чтобы они тоже разрушали их дома и крепости. Они сами были виноваты в своем несчастии и вредили только самим себе.\nВ этом назидание для всех, кто обладает проницательным умом и здравым рассудком. Описанное выше событие наглядно свидетельствует о том, как Аллах поступает с противниками истины и рабами низменных страстей. Могущество не принесло пользы иудеям, а укрепления не сумели защитить их, когда Всевыш- ний Аллах подверг их наказанию за содеянные грехи. Однако смысл этого нази- дания очень велик и не ограничивается конкретным случаем.\nОбсуждаемое нами откровение подразумевает повеление размышлять над этим назиданием, а следовательно, проводить аналогию между схожими фак- тами, задумываться над вытекающими из них законами и размышлять над их смыслом и мудростью. Благодаря этому совершенствуется человеческий ум, развивается сознание, усиливается вера и достигается подлинное представле- ние о сути вещей.\nЗатем Всевышний Аллах поведал о том, что иудеи не получили сполна долж- ного наказания и что их страдания были облегчены.                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(3)</span> Если бы Аллах не предначертал им покинуть родные места и не предопреде- лил это заранее, то их постигло бы совершенно иное возмездие и наказание. Но предопределение Аллаха непреложно. И хотя иудеев миновала мучитель-\nная кара в этом мире, им уготовано наказание огнем в жизни будущей. А на- сколько страшны эти муки ведомо одному Аллаху. Пусть они не думают, что уже вкусили наказания сполна и выстрадали свою долю страданий, ибо Ал- лах приготовил для них в Последней жизни еще более ужасное и невыноси- мое наказание.                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(4)</span> Они заслужили это наказание, потому что откололись от Аллаха и Его посланни- ка, то есть испытывали неприязнь к вере, сражались против нее и усердно ослу- шались ее требований. А ведь Аллах сурово наказывает тех, кто отказывается от повиновения Ему и враждует с Ним.                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(5)</span> Иудеи из племени Надыр порицали посланника Аллаха и мусульман за то, что те срубали пальмы и другие деревья. Они считали, что мусульмане бесчинствуют на их земле, и вменяли им это в преступление. Тогда Всевышний Аллах сказал, что мусульмане лишь выполняли повеление Господа для того, чтобы опозорить грешников. Господь побудил их срубать и сжигать пальмы, чтобы тем самым по- карать, посрамить и унизить неверующих, дабы те узрели свое полное бессилие. Иудеи не смогли защитить свои деревья и спасти их, несмотря на то, что именно финиковые плантации некогда служили опорой их власти.\nСогласно наиболее достоверному толкованию, арабское слово лина <span class=\"green\">(зд. ‘паль- мы’)</span> относится ко всем разновидностям пальмовых деревьев.\nТакой была участь племени Надыр, и таким было их наказание в мирской жизни. Затем Всевышний Аллах сообщил о тех, кому досталось имущество и вла- дения иудеев,<span class=\"blue\"> и сказал:</span>\n</div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(6)</span> О мусульмане! Аллах даровал Своему посланнику, ﷺ, владения и богатство племени Надыр, которое прежде обитало в этих поселениях. Вы не готови- лись к этому сражению заранее, не прилагали особых усилий и не загоняли своих верховых животных. Стоило Аллаху вселить страх в сердца ваших вра- гов, как они сдались на вашу милость. Поистине, Аллах дарует Своим послан-\nникам власть, над кем пожелает. Его власть и могущество безграничны, и по- сему никто не в силах воспротивиться Его воле, и никто не обретет мощи без Его соизволения.\nВоенные трофеи, которые достаются мусульманам без боя либо от сбежавше- го напуганного противника, на языке мусульманского богословия называются фей ‘нечто возвращенное’. Они получили такое название, потому что неверую- щие, которые не достойны вкушать блага Аллаха, возвращают их мусульманам, которым по праву принадлежат земные блага.                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(7)</span> Закон о трофеях распространяется на все подобные случаи,<span class=\"blue\"> потому что Аллах сказал:</span><span class=\"brown\">«Добыча, которую Аллах вернул Своему посланнику от обитателей се- лений»</span>. Здесь имеются в виду любые селения, независимо от того, были они за- воеваны во времена Пророка Мухаммада, ﷺ, или после его смерти, во времена правления мусульманских эмиров. Фей распределяется между Аллахом и Его посланником, родственниками Посланника, ﷺ, сиротами, бедняками и пут- никами. Это откровение похоже на следующий аят из суры <span class=\"brown\">«Аль-Анфаль»</span>:<span class=\"brown\">«Знайте, что если вы захватили трофеи, то пятая часть их принадлежит Ал- лаху, Посланнику, близким родственникам Посланника, сиротам, беднякам и путникам»</span><span class=\"green\">(8:41)</span>.\nТаким образом, фей делится на пять частей. Одна пятая принадлежит Ал- лаху и Его посланнику, ﷺ, и расходуется на нужды мусульман в целом. Одна пятая достается родственникам Пророка, ﷺ, и поровну распределяется между мужчинами и женщинами из рода Хашима и рода аль-Мутталиба, где бы они ни жили. Добыча распределяется только между потомками Хашима и аль-Мутта-\nлиба, а остальные представители рода Абд Манафа не имеют на нее прав, пото- му что только род аль-Мутталиба присоединился к роду Хашима в ущелье и по- могал Пророку Мухаммаду, ﷺ, когда курейшиты договорились бойкотировать его родственников и начали враждовать с ними. Поэтому посланник Аллаха, ﷺ, сказал о роде аль-<span class=\"blue\">Мутталиба:</span><span class=\"brown\">«Они не покидали меня ни во времена невежест- ва, ни в эпоху ислама»</span>.\nОдна пятая часть фея раздается неимущим сиротам, которыми считают- ся несовершеннолетние дети, потерявшие своих отцов. По одной пятой части также получают бедняки и путники, которые не имеют средств к существова- нию на чужбине.\nВсевышний распределил добычу так, дабы она не досталась богатым и зажи- точным людям. Если бы не было этого мудрого законоположения, то богачи рас-\nпределили бы трофеи между собой, а беспомощным беднякам не досталось бы ни гроша. Подобная несправедливость принесла бы много зла, обо всех тяжких последствиях которого известно одному лишь Аллаху.\nЕсли же люди повинуются воле Аллаха и придерживаются законов ша- риата, то они обретают неисчислимые блага. Поэтому Аллах ниспослал пра-<span class=\"blue\"> воверным всеобщее правило и сказал:</span><span class=\"brown\">«Берите то, что дал вам Посланник, и сторонитесь того, что он вам запретил»</span>. Это распространяется как на му- сульманские убеждения, так и на законы шариата. Каждый раб Аллаха обя-\nзан целиком и полностью повиноваться велениям Пророка Мухаммада, ﷺ,\nи руководствоваться его наставлениями, а любое нежелание соглашаться с ними противозаконно. Решение Пророка, ﷺ, по какому-либо вопросу равно- сильно решению Самого Аллаха, и никто ни при каких обстоятельствах не имеет права противиться воле Посланника, ﷺ, или ставить чье-либо мнение превыше его слов.\nЗатем Господь велел правоверным страшиться Его, потому что благодаря этому раб Божий укрепляет свою душу и сердце, благоустраивает свою мир- скую и Последнюю жизнь и обретает вечное счастье и великий удел. А ли- шаясь набожности и благочестия, человек обрекает себя на бесконечные не- счастья и страдания. Вот почему Всевышний велел бояться Его. Поистине, Он сурово карает тех, кто не испытывает страха перед Ним и уступает своим низменным желаниям.                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(8-9)</span> Затем Всевышний поведал, что мудрость и причина предписания распределять фей среди перечисленных пяти категорий состоит в том, что именно они более других достойны заботы и поддержки. Среди них были мухаджиры, которые ради обретения благосклонности Аллаха и любви Его посланника, ﷺ, переселились в Медину, покинули родину, оставили облюбованные ими жилища и расстались с близкими родственниками, любимыми людьми и нажитым богатством.\nОни суть правдивые, которые заслужили этот эпитет, потому что выполняли все требования веры и непрестанно подтверждали свою убежденность праведны- ми деяниями и усердным поклонением Творцу. Они не были похожи на тех, кто называл себя верующим, но избегал борьбы, отказывался переселиться на пути Аллаха и не предался поклонению Ему.\nНа часть военной добычи имели право и ансары, то есть уверовавшие жители Ме- дины. Это — племена аль-Аус и аль-Хазрадж, которые по доброй воле покори- лись Аллаху и Его посланнику. Они искренне возлюбили Пророка Мухаммада,\nﷺ, дали ему надежный кров, приняли решение защищать его от любых врагов\nи превратили свой город в родной дом для уверовавших переселенцев в то время, как все другие земли были очагом войны, язычества и зла.\nВсе, кто стремился помочь религии Аллаха, примыкал к помощникам Алла- ха и Его посланника — ансарам. Это продолжалось до тех пор, пока ислам не ок- реп и не начал распространяться по свету. И тогда мусульмане начали покорять людские сердца знанием, верой и Кораном, а страны — мечами и оружием.\nГоворя о прекрасных качествах ансаров, Всевышний Аллах подчеркнул, что они возлюбили переселившихся к ним мусульман, потому еще раньше они возлюбили Аллаха и Его посланника, ﷺ, и всех, кого любит Аллах и кто помо- гает Его религии. Они не испытывали никакой тяги к тому, что было отдано му-\nхаджирам, и не завидовали той милости, которой Аллах одарил мухаджиров, и тем достоинствам, которыми Он наделил только их. Все это свидетельствует о том, что ансары были великодушными людьми, а злоба и зависть не находили места в их сердцах.\nЭтот аят свидетельствует о превосходстве мухаджиров над ансарами, во-пер- вых, потому что Аллах упомянул о мухаджирах раньше, а во-вторых, потому что Он сообщил, что ансары не питают зависти к тому, чем одарены мухаджиры. Бес- спорно, Всевышний Аллах почтил мухаджиров вознаграждением, которого не получили ни ансары, ни все остальные. И это справедливо, потому что они не только помогали Пророку, но и переселились на пути Аллаха.\nОднако и ансары не были лишены достоинств, которыми они превзошли дру- гих. Одним из этих достоинств было то, что они великодушно отдают своим пере- селившимся братьям и сестрам предпочтение пред собой, хотя сами находятся в стесненном положении. Если человек отдает предпочтение другому перед собой, то его щедрость и великодушие достигли совершенства. Он готов пожертвовать своим богатством и одарить другого, даже если сам нуждается в нем и даже если находится в стесненном положении.\nЭти черты присущи только людям с благородным нравом, которые любят Всевышнего Аллаха сильнее, чем собственные страсти и земные удовольствия. Примером этого служит история одного из ансаров, по поводу которого и было ниспослано это откровение. Когда в его доме заночевали гости, он предпочел на- кормить их, а сам со своей женой и детьми лег спать голодным.\nПодобному великодушию противоположны корысть и эгоизм. Великоду- шие — похвально, а корысть и эгоизм заслуживают порицания, потому что являются проявлениями скупости и алчности. Те, кто наделен великодушием, избавлены от алчности, и они непременно обретут успех. Конечно же, речь идет о тех, кто оградил свою душу не только от алчности, но и от других поро- ков. Если человеку удается избавиться от них, то он смиряется перед повеле-\nниями Аллаха и Его посланника, ﷺ, и покорно выполняет их. Ему становит- ся чуждо все, что запретил Аллах, даже если душа испытывает к этому тягу и влечение. Он начинает расходовать свое имущество на пути Аллаха, стремясь снискать Его благосклонность и обрести вечное блаженство. Воистину, всего этого лишены те, которые не могут оградить себя от алчности и пороков. Они погрязают в них и скупятся на добрые дела, а ведь именно это является источ- ником всякого зла.\nТаким образом, в этих аятах Всевышний упомянул о пречистых сподвиж- никах Пророка — мухаджирах и ансарах. Они были великими имамами му- сульманской общины, которые удостоились почестей и наград и опередили всех, кто был до них и кто пришел после них. Благодаря своим делам и сво- ей вере они стали лучшими среди мусульман и первыми среди богобоязнен- ных верующих.                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(10)</span> Идти путем сподвижников и руководствоваться их примером является честью для всех последующих поколений. Поэтому Всевышний сказал, что последова-<span class=\"blue\"> тели мухаджиров и ансаров говорят:</span><span class=\"brown\">«Господи наш! Прости нас и наших братьев, которые уверовали раньше нас!»</span> Эта молитва подчеркивает не только стремле- ние мусульман заслужить прощение, но и их доброе отношение к остальным пра- воверным. Они молятся за сподвижников Пророка, ﷺ, а также за их верующих предшественников и правоверных последователей. В этом состоит одно из пре-<span class=\"blue\"> восходств истинной веры:</span> верующие помогают друг другу и молятся друг за дру- га. Их объединяет вера, которая призывает мусульман питать друг к другу брат- ские чувства. А одним из проявлений мусульманского братства является мольба друг за друга и взаимная любовь.\nВот почему мусульмане молят Господа не насаждать в их сердцах ни капли ненависти к их братьям по вере. Когда же этого скверного чувства нет, его место занимает любовь к правоверным, дружба с ними, неподдельная благожелатель- ность к ним и все, что обязан испытывать один верующий к другому.\nВсевышний назвал мусульман, которые обратились в ислам после спод- вижников, верующими. А слова их молитвы свидетельствуют о том, что спод- вижников Пророка и их последователей объединяет единая вера и общие воз- зрения. Этой чести удостаиваются истинные последователи Пророка и сто- ронники единой общины, потому что никто иной в полной мере не обладает упомянутыми выше качествами.\nПраведные мусульмане всегда признают свои ошибки и грехи, молят о про- щении за себя и за других и просят Аллаха избавить их от ненависти и зло- бы к своим верующим братьям. Обо всем этом свидетельствуют слова, с кото- рыми они взывают к Аллаху. Воистину, эти слова проникнуты любовью друг к другу. Эта любовь заставляет мусульман желать для своих братьев того же,\nчего они желают для себя, и питать к ним искренние и нежные чувства, не- зависимо от того, далеко они или близко, живы они или умерли. Этот свя- щенный аят учит тому, как правоверные должны соблюдать свои обязаннос- ти друг перед другом.\nЗатем Господь подчеркнул, что они заканчивают свою молитву, обращаясь к Аллаху Его прекрасными именами — Сострадательный, Милосердный. Эти два благородных имени Аллаха указывают на совершенство Его милости, сострада- ния и добродетели по отношению к Его творениям, величайшим проявлением которых является Его помощь Своим рабам в соблюдении ими обязанностей пе- ред Ним и людьми.\nТаким образом, Всевышний отметил достоинства и качества праведных му- сульман — мухаджиров, ансаров и их последователей. Именно они заслужили право на военную добычу, которая целиком и полностью расходуется на благо ислама, и были удостоены многих великих почестей. Господи! По милости Своей и великодушию сделай нас в их числе!                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(11)</span> Всевышний выразил свое удивление поступкам лицемеров, которые пообещали своим собратьям из числа людей Писания помощь и поддержку и подтолкнули их на противостояние правоверным. Лицемеры обещали иудеям не бросать их в трудную минуту, даже если их будут укорять или запугивать. Они обещали ока- зать им помощь и поддержку даже в том случае, если мусульмане решатся сра- зиться с ними. Но Аллах — свидетель тому, что они лгут, обольщая своих собра- тьев лживыми обещаниями.                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(12)</span> Они нередко поступают так, потому что ложь — черта их характера, обман и обольщение — их жизненные принципы, а лицемерие и трусость — их удел. Поэтому Аллах назвал их слова лживыми и предвозвестил их предательство и измену. И действительно, все произошло именно так, как предсказал Аллах. Он поведал, что если иудеи будут покидать свои дома, то лицемеры не после- дуют за ними, потому что они любят родные места, не готовы терпеть тяготы\nсражений и не привыкли выполнять данные ими обещания. Их сердцами овла- деют трусость и малодушие, и они бросят своих собратьев в беде в тот час, ког- да те более всего будут нуждаться в их помощи. А если они и придут, то обяза- тельно повернут вспять.\nПоследняя фраза является предположением, которому не дано сбыться. Ник- то не поможет противникам ислама, поскольку лицемеры ни за что не станут сра- жаться на их стороне, а Всевышний Аллах не окажет им поддержки.                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(13)</span> О верующие! Причина их измены и предательства в том, что они боятся вас сильнее, чем Аллаха. Они боятся творений, которые даже самим себе не спо- собны причинить вред или принести пользу, и забывают о Всемогущем Твор- це, Который распоряжается добром и злом, Который одних одаряет милостью, а других лишает ее.\nА все дело в том, что они не разумеют истинной сути вещей и не думают о последствиях. Воистину, здравый рассудок призывает людей страшиться Ал- лаха, надеяться на Него и любить Его сильнее, чем кого бы то ни было иного, а свои чувства к творениям ставить в зависимость от своих чувств к Всевышне- му Творцу.                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(14)</span> Даже объединившись вместе они не станут решительно сражаться с вами, разве что находясь в укрепленных селениях или за высокими стенами и ограждения- ми. Вот тогда, возможно, они окажут вам сопротивление. Но это не говорит об их мужестве, потому что они будут полагаться не на самих себя, а на крепости и стены. Воистину, это — величайший позор.\nМеж собой у них жестокая вражда, но причина этого не в слабости их рук и не в недостатке мощи, а в слабости их веры и отсутствии единства. Ты пола- гаешь, что они едины, когда видишь, как они собираются вместе и делают вид, что помогают друг другу. Но в действительности сердца их разобщены, разроз- ненны и переполнены взаимной враждой, потому что они лишены разума и здравого смысла.\nЕсли бы они обладали способностью здраво мыслить, то не отдали бы пред- почтения худшему перед лучшим и не избрали бы для себя самый скверный удел. Их цели были бы общими, сердца — сплоченными, а сами они оказывали бы друг другу поддержку и помощь как в духовных, так и в мирских делах. Но\nлицемеры избрали для себя иной путь, так же как и брошенные ими в трудный час иудеи, которым Аллах отомстил за Своего посланника и которых Он посра- мил уже в этом мире.                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(15)</span> Они подобны неверующим курейшитам, в глазах которых сатана приукрасил их деяния, а затем ничем не помог им.<span class=\"blue\"> А ведь он обещал им:</span><span class=\"brown\">«Сегодня никто из лю- дей не одолеет вас. Воистину, я буду по соседству»</span>. Но когда два отряда увидели друг друга,<span class=\"blue\"> он повернул вспять и сказал:</span><span class=\"brown\">«Я не причастен к вам. Воистину, я ви- жу то, чего вы не видите»</span><span class=\"green\">(8:48)</span>.\nКурейшитов обольстило их численность и сила, но все это ни принесло им ус- пеха и не избавило их от Божьей кары. Доблестно и кичливо они направлялись на сражение при Бадре, считая, что сумеют одолеть посланника Аллаха и верую- щих.<span class=\"blue\"> Однако Аллах даровал победу Своему пророку и верующим:</span> они порубили старейшин и вождей неверующих и захватили в плен многих из них. А осталь- ные язычники смогли спастись лишь бегством. Так они вкусили пагубность сво- их деяний и тяжкие последствия своего распутства и многобожия. Таков их удел в этой жизни, а в будущей им уготована мучительная кара.                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(16)</span> Что же касается лицемеров, то они подобны сатане,<span class=\"blue\"> который говорит человеку:</span><span class=\"brown\">«Не веруй!»</span> Тем самым сатана приукрашивает в глазах человека неверие, а ког- да тот поддается соблазну и встает на путь неверия и вечного несчастья, то сата- на, некогда призывавший его к этому, ничем не помогает ему и отрекается от не- го. Он признается, что не способен избавить человека от мук и страданий и при- нести ему пользу даже размером с одну крупинку.                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(17)</span> Сатану, который призывает к неверию и неповиновению Аллаху, и людей, которые последовали за ним, ожидает одинаковый исход.

Такова участь нечестивцев, которые предались несправедливости и неверию. Каждый из них получит наказание, соразмерное с тяжестью совершенных им грехов.\nТаково отношение сатаны к собственным клевретам. Вначале он обольщает их и призывает последовать его путем, на котором их не ожидает ничего, кро- ме зла и вреда, а когда они попадают в его сети и над ними нависает погибель, он отрекается от них и оставляет их наедине с вечными муками. Унижен и посрам- лен будет всякий, кто последует за сатаной, ибо Аллах предостерег Своих рабов от этого, предупредил их о пагубных последствиях этого и поведал им о задачах и целях их явного врага. Поэтому всякий, кто повинуется сатане, восстает про- тив здравого разума и не имеет никакого оправдания.                </div>"

class=\"green\">(1)</span> این سوره، سورۀ بنی نضیر نامیده می‌شود. بنی نضیر طایفۀ بزرگی بودند که در گوشه‌ای از مدینه در زمان پیامبر صلی الله علیه وسلم ساکن بودند. وقتی پیامبر صلی الله علیه وسلم مبعوث شد و به مدینه هجرت کرد، به همراه دیگر یهودیانی که به پیامبر کفر ورزیدند آنها نیز بدو کافر شدند. سپس پیامبر با قبیله‌های یهودی که در مدینه همسایۀ او بودند پیمان صلح امضا کرد. نزدیک شش ماه بعد از رخداد جنگ بدر، پیامبر نزد آنها رفت و با آنها سخن گفت تا در پرداخت دیۀ کلاّبی‌هایی که عمرو بن امیّۀ ضمری کشته بود او را یاری نمایند. آنها گفتند چنین خواهیم کرد ای ابا القاسم،اینجا بنشین تا نیاز تو را برآورده سازیم. آنگاه برخی از یهودیان بنی‌نضیر با هم به نجوا و خلوت پرداختند، و شیطان شقاوتی را که برایشان مقرّر شده بود زیبا جلوه داد، و نقشۀ کشتن پیامبر را کشیدند، و گفتند کدام یک از شما حاضر است این سنگ را بالای بام ببرد و آن را روی سر پیامبر صلی الله علیه وسلم بیندازد تا سنگ به سرش بخورد.<span class=\"blue\"> شقی‌ترین آنها عمرو بن جحاش گفت:</span> من این کار را می‌کنم.<span class=\"blue\"> سلام بن مشکم به آنها گفت:</span> چنین مکنید، سوگند به خدا که او از آنچه اراده کرده‌اید باخبر خواهد شد، و این کار شما شکستن عهدی است که میان ما و اوست. بلافاصله از سوی خداوند به پیامبر وحی شد و از قصد یهودیان باخبر گردید.<span class=\"blue\"> پس شتابان از جای خود برخاست و به سوی مدینه رهسپار شد و یارانش به او پیوستند و گفتند:</span> برخاستی و متوجّه نشدیم! پیامبر صلی الله علیه وسلم یارانش را از آنچه یهودیان می‌خواستند انجام دهند باخبر کرد.<span class=\"blue\"> پیامبر صلی الله علیه وسلم کسی را نزد آنها فرستاد و فرمود:</span><span class=\"brown\">«از مدینه بیرون بروید و در کنار من در مدینه ساکن مباشید. من به شما ده روز مهلت می‌دهم و هرکس را بعد از آن ده روز ببینم گردنش را خواهم زد.»</span> بعد از آن چند روزی بود که آنها مشغول آماده کردن خود برای خروج از مدینه بودند که عبدالله بن ابی بن سلول منافق،<span class=\"blue\"> فردی را نزد آنها فرستاد و گفت:</span> از سرزمین خود بیرون نروید، من دو هزار نفر دارم که همراه شما وارد قلعه‌تان خواهند شد و در دفاع از شما خواهند مُرد، و قبیلۀ بنی قریظه و هم‌پیمانانتان از غطفان شما را یاری خواهند کرد. رئیس و سردار یهودیان حییّ بن اخطب به آنچه عبدالله منافق گفته بود امیدوار شد،<span class=\"blue\"> و قاصدی نزد پیامبر صلی الله علیه وسلم فرستاد و گفت:</span> ما از سرزمین خود بیرون نمی‌رویم، هرچه که می‌خواهی بکن. آنگاه پیامبر صلی الله علیه وسلم و یارانش تکبیر گفتند و بلند شدند و به سوی آنها حرکت کردند و پرچم مسلمین را علی‌بن‌ابی‌طالب به دوش داشت. مسلمان‌ها قلعه‌های یهودیان را محاصره کرده و به سوی آنها تیراندازی ‌کردند و سنگ پرتاب ‌نمودند. بنی‌قریظه، یهودیان بنی‌نضیر را یادی نکرده و از آنها دوری گزیدند، و عبدالله بن ابی و هم‌پیمانانشان از قبیلۀ غطفان به آنها خیانت کردند. پیامبر صلی الله علیه وسلم آنها را محاصره کرد و درختان خرمای آنها را قطع نمود و آتش زد.<span class=\"blue\"> آنها کسی را نزد رسول خدا فرستادند و گفتند:</span> از مدینه خارج می‌شویم. پس رسول خدا اجازه داد که خودشان و زن و بچّه‌هایشان از مدینه خارج شوند، و از اموال و دارایی‌هایشان بارِ یک شتر را با خود ببرند. <span class=\"brown\">[اما پیامبر فرمود که]</span> حقّ ندارند اسلحه‌هایشان را با خود ببرند. پس رسول خدا همۀ اموال و دارایی و اسلحه‌های آنان را به غنیمت برد. و تمام اموال و اسلحه‌های برجای مانده از طایفۀ بنی نضیر به طور خالص برای رسول خدا و مصالح مسلمانان بود. و پیامبر آن را به صورت خُمس تقسیم نکرد. چراکه خداوند آن را به رسم <span class=\"brown\">«فَئ»</span> عاید پیامبر خود گردانید، و مسلمانان برای تصاحب آن اسب یا شتری نتاختند. پس رسول خدا صلی الله علیه وسلم آنان را به سوی خیبر بیرون راند. و حیی ابن اخطب بزرگ آنان از جملۀ بیرون راندگان بود. پس بر زمین و خانه‌هایشان سیطره یافت و اسلحه‌هایشان را به غنیمت برد که <span class=\"green\">(50)</span> سپر، و <span class=\"green\">(50)</span> کلاه و <span class=\"green\">(340)</span> شمشیر بود. این داستان آنان بود، آنچنان که اهل سیره روایت کرده‌اند. خداوند متعال این سوره را طوری آغاز کرد که در آن بیان نمود تمامی آنچه که در آسمان‌ها و زمین به سر می‌برند در برابر عظمت او کرنش می‌کنند. و همه چیز در برابر او فروتن می‌باشد؛ چون او توانمندی است که بر همه چیز چیره و غالب است. پس هیچ چیزی برای او دشوار نیست، و او در آفرینش و فرمان خود با حکمت است، و هیچ چیزی را بیهوده نمی‌آفریند، و آنچه را که مصلحتی در آن نیست مشروع نمی‌نماید، و فقط کاری می‌کند که مقتضای حکمت اوست. از جمله کارهای حکیمانۀ خداوند این است که پیامبرش را بر کافرانِ اهل کتاب <span class=\"brown\">[=بنی‌نضیر]</span> ـ وقتی که به پیامبر خیانت کردند ـ پیروز گردانید، و آنها را از سرزمین و وطنشان که به آن اُنس گرفته بودند بیرون راند.                </div><div lang=\"fa\" class=\"fa \">\n<span class=\"green\">(2)</span> و بیرون راندنشان، اوّلین خروج و جلای وطنی بود که خداوند به دست پیامبرش صلی الله علیه وسلم بر آنها مقرّر داشت. آنها از مدینه به سوی خیبر بیرون رفتند. این آیۀ کریمه دلالت می‌کند که آنها علاوه بر این بار، باری دیگر نیز از وطن خود بیرون رانده خواهند شد. و آن این بود که پیامبر صلی الله علیه وسلم آنها را از خیبر نیز بیرون راند، و بعد از ایشان عمر باز‌مانده‌های یهودیان را هم بیرون راند. (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿مَا ظَنَنتُمۡ أَن يَخۡرُجُواۡ﴾</span>) شما مسلمان‌ها گمان نمی‌کردید که یهودیان از سرزمین و خانه‌هایشان بیرون بروند، چون آنها دژهای محکمی داشتند و قدرتمند بودند. (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَظَنُّوٓاۡ أَنَّهُم مَّانِعَتُهُمۡ حُصُونُهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ﴾</span>) و گمان بردند که دژهایشان آنان را از عذاب خدا محافظت می‌کند. بنابراین به دژهای خود بالیدند، و دژهای محکم آنها را فریب داد و گمان بردند که در آنجا گزندی به آنها نخواهد رسید، و هیچ کس توانایی دسترسی به آنها را نخواهد داشت. امّا خداوند چنین مقرّر کرده بود که دژها و قلعه‌ها چیزی از عذاب خداوند را از آنها دور نخواهد کرد، و در برابر فرمان الهی، قدرت و دفاع فایده‌ای نخواهد داشت.<span class=\"blue\"> بنابراین فرمود:</span> (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿فَأَتَىٰهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِنۡ حَيۡثُ لَمۡ يَحۡتَسِبُواۡ﴾</span>) پس خداوند از جایی به سراغشان آمد که گمان نبرده بودند از آنجا گرفتار می‌شوند. و آن این بود که (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَقَذَفَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلرُّعۡبَ﴾</span>) خداوند در دل‌هایشان ترس و هراس انداخت. رعب؛ یعنی ترس و هراس شدید، که به مثابۀ بزرگ‌ترین لشکر خداوند است؛ و اگر دشمن را فرابگیرد، هیچ ساز و برگ و نیرویی افاقه نخواهد کرد. آنچه آنها گمان می‌بردند که خطر را از آنان دور می‌کند، قلعه و دژهایی بود که خود را در آن حفاظت نموده و در آن سنگر گرفته بودند و در پناه آن آسوده به سر می‌بردند. امّا هرکس که به غیر از خداوند اعتماد کند، خوار و ذلیل خواهد گشت؛ و هرکس به غیر از خداوند تکیه نماید، همان چیز بلای جانش خواهد شد. پس امری آسمانی بر دل‌های یهودیان فرود آمد. دل‌ها محل پایداری و شکیبایی و یا ترس و ضعف می‌باشند. پس این امر آسمانی و هراس، قدرت و توانمندی دل‌هایشان را از بین برد، و به جای آن ضعف و ترس و بزدلی قرار داد، و برای دفع آن چاره‌ای نداشتند. و این ترس، دشمنی دیگر برای آنها گردید.<span class=\"blue\"> بنابراین فرمود:</span> (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿يُخۡرِبُونَ بُيُوتَهُم بِأَيۡدِيهِمۡ وَأَيۡدِي ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ﴾</span>) خانه‌هایشان را با دست‌های خود و دست‌های مؤمنان ویران می‌کردند؛ چون آنها با پیامبر بر این چیز صلح کردند که فقط به اندازۀ بار شترهایشان با خود ببرند. از این رو بسیاری از خانه‌هایشان را منهدم و خراب کردند. خانه‌هایی که آن را بسیار خوب ساخته بودند، و مؤمنان بر آنها چیره شدند. خانه‌هایشان را خراب و دژها و قلعه‌هایشان را منهدم کردند. پس آنها بودند که بر خود جنایت کردند و به خود ضربه زدند. (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿فَٱعۡتَبِرُواۡ يَٰٓأُوۡلِي ٱلۡأَبۡصَٰرِ﴾</span>) پس ای صاحبان خرد و بصیرت! و ای کسانی که دارای عقل‌های کامل هستید! پند و عبرت بگیرید. چون این درس عبرتی است که چگونگی برخورد خداوند با کسانی که مخالف حقّ هستند و از هوی و هوس خود پیروی می‌کنند از آن شناخته می‌شود، آنهایی که قدرتشان به آنان سودی نبخشید، و قلعه‌هایشان نتوانست آنها را حفاظت کند، بدانگاه که فرمان الهی به سراغشان آمد. پس آنها به سبب گناهانشان مورد شکنجه و عذاب قرار گرفتند. و این موضوع امری کلّی است، و آنچه اعتبار دارد عموم مفهوم و موضوع است نه سبب و دلیل خاص آن. این آیه امر می‌نماید که از سرنوشت بنی نضیر درس عبرت گرفته شود، و اینکه امور مشابه با یکدیگر مقایسه گردند و در مفاهیم و حکمت‌هایی که جای خردورزی و اندیشیدن است، و با این کار عقل کامل می‌گردد و بصیرت نافذ می‌شود و ایمان فزونی می‌یابد و انسان را به فهم و درک حقیقی می‌رساند تأمل و اندیشه صورت گیرد. سپس خداوند متعال خبر داد که یهودیان به همۀ کیفرهایی که سزاوار آن بودند نرسیدند بلکه خداوند به آنها تخفیف داد.                </div><div lang=\"fa\" class=\"fa \">\n<span class=\"green\">(3)</span> (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَلَوۡلَآ أَن كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيۡهِمُ ٱلۡجَلَآءَ﴾</span>) و اگر خداوند ترک دیار و آوارگی را بر آنان مقرّر نمی‌کرد، به عذاب دیگری در دنیا گرفتار می‌شدند. ولی آنها- گرچه عذاب سخت دنیوی به آنها نرسید- در آخرت عذاب آتش دوزخ را دارند که شدّت و سختی آن را کسی جز خداوند نمی‌داند. پس آنها نباید چنین فکر کنند که عذاب و کیفرشان به آنها رسیده و تمام شده است؛ زیرا عذابی که خداوند در آخرت برای آنها آماده کرده بزرگ‌تر و کامل‌تر است.                </div><div lang=\"fa\" class=\"fa

مبارزه برخاسته‌اند، و برای سرپیچی از خدا و رسولش کوشیده‌اند، و هرکس که با خدا دشمنی ورزد، سنّت الهی دربارۀ او همین است. (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَمَن يُشَآقِّ ٱللَّهَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلۡعِقَابِ﴾</span>) و هر کس با خداوند دشمنی ورزد، بداند که خداوند سخت کیفر است.                </div><div lang=\"fa\" class=\"fa \">\n<span class=\"green\">(5)</span> قبیلۀ بنی‌نضیر، پیامبر صلی الله علیه وسلم و مسلمان‌ها را سرزنش کردند که چرا درختان خرما و دیگر درختان را قطع کرده است، و ادعا نمودند که این کار فساد و تباهی است، از این رو مسلمین را مورد طعنه و عیب‌جویی قرار دادند. خداوند متعال خبر داد که بریدن درختان خرما و بر جای گذاشتن آن از سوی مسلمانان (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿فَبِإِذۡنِ ٱللَّهِ﴾</span>) به فرمان و اذن خداوند بوده است. (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَلِيُخۡزِيَ ٱلۡفَٰسِقِينَ﴾</span>) و برای آن بوده تا خداوند بدکاران را خوار و رسوا بگرداند. شما را مسلّط کرد تا درختانشان را قطع کنید و بسوزانید تا این کار عذابی باشد برای آنها و مایۀ خواری و رسوایی‌شان در دنیا گردد. و تا ضعف و ناتوانی کاملشان مشخّص ‌شود. آنجا که نتوانستند درختان خرمای خود را که مایه‌ی نیرو و قوت آنان بود، نجات دهند.<span class=\"blue\"> اللینة:</span> نامی است که بنابر قول صحیح‌تر شامل تمامی انواع نخل می‌شود. این بود حالت قبیلۀ بنی نضیر، و اینکه خداوند چگونه آنها را در دنیا کیفر داد.                </div><div lang=\"fa\" class=\"fa \">\n<span class=\"green\">(6)</span> سپس بیان کرد که اموال و کالاهایشان به چه کسی می‌رسد.<span class=\"blue\"> پس فرمود:</span> (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَمَآ أَفَآءَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِۦ مِنۡهُمۡ﴾</span>) چیزهایی از دارائی اهل این آبادی؛ یعنی بنی‌نضیر که خداوند به پیامبرش ارزانی داشت، (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿فَمَآ أَوۡجَفۡتُمۡ عَلَيۡهِ مِنۡ خَيۡلٖ وَلَا رِكَابٖ﴾</span>) شما ای گروه مسلمان‌ها! برای به دست آوردن آن اسبان و شترانی را نتاخته بودید؛ یعنی برای به دست آوردن آن رنجی نبرده‌اید؛ نه خودتان و نه چهارپایانتان بلکه خداوند در دل‌های یهودیان ترس و هراس انداخت و این اموال بدون زحمت به دست شما رسید.<span class=\"blue\"> بنابراین فرمود:</span> (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُسَلِّطُ رُسُلَهُۥ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُۚ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ قَدِيرٞ﴾</span>) ولی خداوند پیغمبرانش را بر هرکس که بخواهد چیره می‌گرداند، و خداوند بر هر چیزی تواناست. و از کمال قدرت الهی این است که هیچ امر محال و ناممکنی برای او ناممکن نیست، و هیچ قدرتمندی در برابر او نیرویی ندارد. <span class=\"brown\">«فئ»</span> در اصطلاح فقها به اموالی گفته می‌شود که بدون جنگ و به حق از کافران ستانده می‌شود. مانند مال و دارایی‌ای که یهودیان فرار کردند و آن را از ترس مسلمین رها نمودند. چنین مالی <span class=\"brown\">«فئ»</span> نامیده می‌شود، چون از کافرانی که مستحق آن نیستند به مسلمان‌هایی برگشته است که حقّ کامل در آن دارند.                </div><div lang=\"fa\" class=\"fa \">\n<span class=\"green\">(7)</span> حکم کلی <span class=\"brown\">«فئ»</span> همان طور است که خداوند بیان داشته است، (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿مَّآ أَفَآءَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِۦ مِنۡ أَهۡلِ ٱلۡقُرَىٰ﴾</span>) هر آنچه از اموال و دارایی‌های اهالی آبادی‌ها که خداوند به پیغمبرش ارزانی داشته است، همچنین به طور کلّی چه در زمان پیامبر و چه بعد از او کسی که حکومت را در دست دارد اگر چنین اموالی را به دست آورد، (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿فَلِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِي ٱلۡقُرۡبَىٰ وَٱلۡيَتَٰمَىٰ وَٱلۡمَسَٰكِينِ وَٱبۡنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ﴾</span>) این اموال متعلّق به خدا و پیغمبر و خویشاوندان پیغمبر و یتیمان و بینوایان و در راه ماندگان است.<span class=\"blue\"> این آیه شبیه آیه‌ایست که در سورۀ انفال آمده است:</span><span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَٱعۡلَمُوٓاۡ أَنَّمَا غَنِمۡتُم مِّن شَيۡءٖ فَأَنَّ لِلَّهِ خُمُسَهُۥ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِي ٱلۡقُرۡبَىٰ وَٱلۡيَتَٰمَىٰ وَٱلۡمَسَٰكِينِ وَٱبۡنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ﴾</span> و بدانید هرآنچه که به صورت غنیمت به دست می‌آورید یک پنجم آن از آن پیغمبر و خویشاوندان او و یتیمان و بینوایان و در راه ماندگان است.<span class=\"blue\"> پس این غنیمت به پنج گروه می‌رسد:</span> سهم خدا و پیغمبرش در مصالح و منافع عمومی و کلّ مسلمین صرف می‌گردد. و یک پنجم آن به خویشاوندان پیامبر؛ یعنی بنی هاشم و فرزندان مطلب می‌رسد هرکجا که باشند، و سهمیه زن و مردشان برابر است. بنی مطلب به خلاف سایرین بنی عبد مناف بدین خاطر با بنی‌هاشم در یک پنجم شریک هستند چون در ورود به شعب ابی‌طالب وقتی که قریش پیامبر و بنی‌هاشم را تحریم اقتصادی کردند و بر دشمنی ورزیدن و قهر کردن از آنها پیمان بستند با بنی‌هاشم همراه بودند.<span class=\"blue\"> بنابراین پیامبر صلی الله علیه وسلم در مورد بنی عبدالمطلب فرمود:</span> آنها در زمان جاهلیت و در اسلام مرا تنها نگذاشتند و از من جدا نشدند. و یک پنجم به مستمندان یتیم می‌رسد. یتیم کسی است که پدرش را از دست داده و هنوز به سن رشد و بلوغ نرسیده است. و یک پنجم به فقرا می‌رسد. و یک پنجم سهم مسافرانی است که در دیار غربت مانده‌اند و مخارج سفر ندارند. خداوند تقسیم <span class=\"brown\">«فئ»</span> را در این افراد مشخّص منحصر گرداند. (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿كَيۡ لَا يَكُونَ دُولَةَۢ بَيۡنَ ٱلۡأَغۡنِيَآءِ مِنكُمۡ﴾</span>) تا بین ثروتمندان دست به دست نگردد، به گونه‌ای که به دیگر افراد ناتوان و عاجز نرسد، که قطعاً از چنین امری فساد بزرگی روی خواهد داد. همان‌طور که در پیروی کردن از فرمان خدا و شریعت و آئین او، منافع و مصلحت‌های بی‌شماری وجود دارد.<span class=\"blue\"> بنابراین خداوند به رعایت قاعده و اصل کلّی دستور داد و فرمود:</span> (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَمَآ ءَاتَىٰكُمُ ٱلرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَىٰكُمۡ عَنۡهُ فَٱنتَهُواۡ﴾</span>) آنچه پیامبر برای شما از <span class=\"brown\">[احکام الهی]</span> آورده است آن را اجرا کنید، و آنچه شما را از آن بازداشته است از آن دست بکشید. و این شامل اصول و فروع دین، و ظاهر و باطن آن می‌شود. و هر حکمی که پیامبر می‌دهد بندگان باید به آن چنگ بزنند و آن را اجرا کنند، و مخالفت با فرمان پیغمبر جایز نیست. و هر آنچه پیامبر بگوید همانند دستور خداوند لازم‌الاجرا است، و هیچ کس اجازه ندارد آن را ترک نماید و برای ترک کردن آن عذری بیاورد. و مقدم داشتن سخن هیچ کسی بر سخن و حکم پیامبر جایز نیست. سپس خداوند مردم را فرمان داد تا از او بترسند و پروا کنند؛ زیرا دل‌ها و ارواح و دنیا و آخرت با تقوای الهی آباد می‌گردند، و به وسیلۀ تقوا و پرهیزگاری است که سعادت همیشگی و رستگاری بزرگ به دست می‌آید. و با ضایع کردن تقوا و بی‌اعتنایی به آن، شقاوت همیشگی و عذاب جاودانگی به سراغ انسان می‌آید.<span class=\"blue\"> پس فرمود:</span> (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَٱتَّقُواۡ ٱللَّهَۖ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلۡعِقَابِ﴾</span>) و از خداوند بترسید؛ بی‌گمان، خداوند سخت کیفر است، و هر کس تقوا را ترک کند و پیروی کردن از هوی و هوس و خواسته‌های نفس را ترجیح دهد، او را سخت کیفر می‌دهد.                </div><div lang=\"fa\" class=\"fa \">\n<span class=\"green\">(8 - 9)</span> سپس خداوند متعال حکمت و سبب اختصاص یافتن غنایم به افراد مشخّصی را بیان کرد، و اینکه آنها سزاوار کمک هستند، و سزاوارند که غنایم به آنها تعلّق بگیرد.<span class=\"blue\"> پس بیان کرد که آنها یا مهاجر هستند که چیزهای دوست‌داشتنی از قبیل:</span> سرزمین و اموال خود و دوستان خویش را به خاطر خداوند و به خاطر محبّت پیامبر ترک کرده و هجرت نموده‌اند. اینها راستگویانی هستند که به مقتضای ایمان خویش عمل کرده‌اند، و با اعمال صالح خود و عبادت‌های دشوار، صداقت ایمان خود را ثابت نموده‌اند. به خلاف کسی که ادّعای ایمان می‌کند امّا ادّعـای خویش را با جهاد و هجرت و دیگر عبادت‌ها ثابت نکرده است. و این مستحقّان یا انصار هستند از قبیلۀ اوس و خزرج که با میل و رغبت خود و بدون اجبار به خدا و پیامبرش ایمان آوردند، و پیامبر صلی الله علیه وسلم را جای دادند و او را از هر دشمنی محافظت کردند، و دارالهجره و دارالایمان را آماده نمودند تا اینکه تبدیل به پناهگاهی برای مؤمنان گردید که به آن مراجعه ‌کردند و به آن پناه ‌بردند. و زمانی که همۀ شهرها و آبادی‌ها محل مبارزه با دین خدا و لانۀ شرک و فساد بود، مسلمان‌ها فقط در مدینه می‌توانستند اقامت نمایند. پس همواره یاوران دین به انصار پناهنده می‌شدند تا اینکه اسلام گسترش یافت و قدرت گرفت و روز به روز تعداد مسلمانان و قلمرو اسلام بیشتر ‌شد، و دل‌های مردم را به وسیلۀ علم و ایمان و قرآن فتح کردند، و کشورها و شهرها را با شمشیر و نیزه گشودند. انصار از جمله صفت‌های زیبایشان این بود که (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿يُحِبُّونَ مَنۡ هَاجَرَ إِلَيۡهِمۡ﴾</span>) کسانی را که به نزد ایشان هجرت کرده‌اند دوست می‌دارند. و این به خاطر آن است که آنها خدا و پیغمبرش را دوست دارند از این رو دوستان خدا را دوست می‌دارند، و هرکس را که دین خدا را یاری نماید دوست می‌دارند. (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَلَا يَجِدُونَ فِي صُدُورِهِمۡ حَاجَةٗ مِّمَّآ أُوتُواۡ﴾</span>) و در دل‌های خود نسبت به مهاجران ـ به خاطرنعمت‌هایی که خداوند به آنان داده است ـ حسد و کینه نمی‌ورزند، و این نشانگر پاکی و سالم بودن دل‌های آنهاست و دالّ بر این است که دل‌هایشان از خیانت و کینه و حسد پاک و به دور است. و این دلالت می‌نماید که مهاجران از انصار برتر هستند؛ چون خداوند اول از مهاجران یاد نموده و خبر داده است که انصار به خاطر فضیلت‌ها و برتری‌هایی که مهاجرین دارند نسبت به آنان حسد نمی‌ورزند. و این دلالت می‌نماید که خداوند به آنها چیزهایی داده که به انصار و دیگران نداده است؛ چون مهاجران هم هجرت کرده و هم پیامبر را یاری نموده‌اند. (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَيُؤۡثِرُونَ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمۡ وَلَوۡ كَانَ بِهِمۡ خَصَاصَةٞ﴾</span>) یکی از صفت‌های انصار به سبب ایثار و از خودگذشتگی بر دیگران برتری یافته‌اند. ایثار کامل‌ترین نوع بخشندگی است، واینکه انسان اموال و چیزهایی را که دوست دارد و به آن نیازمند است برای دیگران خرج کند. و ضمن آنکه نیاز مبرم داشته باشد، آن را به دیگران بدهد. چنین امری جز از اخلاق و خویی وارسته برنمی‌آید. نیز سرچشمۀ آن محبّت خداست که آن را بر محبّت و خواسته‌ها و امیال نفس و لذّت‌های آن مقدم داشته‌اند. از همین مورد است داستان مرد انصاری که آیه در رابطه با او نازل شده است. او مهمانش را بر خودش ترجیح داد، و غذا را به مهمان داد و خود و خانواده و فرزندانش گرسنه خوابیدند تا مهمانشان سیر بخوابد. ایثار امری پسندیده است، و بخل ورزیدن ناپسند،<span class=\"blue\"> و هر کس که دارای ایثار و از خود گذشتگی باشد به راستی که از آفت بخل مصون مانده است:</span> (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَمَن يُوقَ شُحَّ نَفۡسِهِۦ فَأُوۡلَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلۡمُفۡلِحُونَ﴾</span>) و هرکس که از بخل نفس خود مصون گردد، چنین کسانی قطعاً رستگارند. و مصون بودن نفس از بخل شامل مصون بودن از بخل در همۀ چیزهایی است که انسان بدان امر شده است. پس هرگاه بنده از بخل نفس خود مصون باشد، نفس او فرامین خدا و رسولش را اجرا می‌کند، و این فرامین را با علاقه و شرح صدر انجام می‌دهد. و از آنچه که خدا نهی کرده است دوری می‌گزیند، گرچه برایش دوست داشتنی باشد، و نفس و شهوت، او را به انجام آن فرابخواند. نیز اموال خود را در راه خدا و طلب رضایت او خرج می‌کند، و با این کار رستگاری و کامیابی را به دست می‌آورد. به خلاف کسی که از بخل نفس خود مصون نباشد و به بخل مبتلا گردد و در انجام هر کار خیری بخیل باشد؛ بخلی که اساس و مادۀ هر شرّ و بدی است. پس این دو گروه وارسته، اصحاب و یاران بزرگوار پیامبر و پیشوایان هستند؛ کسانی که به فضیلت‌ها و خوبی‌هایی دست یافته‌اند که آنان که بعد از آنها آمده‌اند به چنان خوبی‌هایی نایل نگردیده‌اند. پس اینها برجستگان و سران مسلمانان و رهبران پرهیزگاران گشته‌اند.                </div><div lang=\"fa\" class=\"fa \">\n<span class=\"green\">(10)</span> و برای کسانی که پس از آنها می‌آیند، همین فضیلت کافی است که در مسیر آنها حرکت کنند و به رهنمود آنان اقتدا نمایند.<span class=\"blue\"> بنابراین خداوند پیشینیانی را که به آنها اقتدا نموده‌اند بیان کرد و فرمود:</span> (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَٱلَّذِينَ جَآءُو مِنۢ بَعۡدِهِمۡ﴾</span>) و کسانی که بعد از مهاجرین و انصار به دنیا می‌آیند، (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿يَقُولُونَ﴾</span>) در قالب خیرخواهی برای خود و همۀ مؤمنان می‌گویند: (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿رَبَّنَا ٱغۡفِرۡ لَنَا وَلِإِخۡوَٰنِنَا ٱلَّذِينَ سَبَقُونَا بِٱلۡإِيمَٰنِ﴾</span>) پروردگارا! ما و برادران ما را که در ایمان آوردن از ما پیشی گرفته‌اند بیامرز.<span class=\"blue\"> و این دعایی است که همۀ مؤمنان گذشته را از قبیل:</span> اصحاب و کسانی که پیش از آنها و بعد از آنها بوده‌اند شامل می‌شود. و این از فضائل ایمان است که مؤمنان از یکدیگر استفاده می‌برند و برای یکدیگر دعا می‌کنند، چون همه در ایمان مشارکت دارند، و ایمان است که میان مؤمنان پیوند برادری ایجاد می‌کند، و به سبب این پیوند برای یکدیگر دعا می‌کنند و یکدیگر را دوست می‌دارند. بنابراین خداوند در این دعا بیان کرد که کینه‌ای در دل‌هایشان نسبت به همدیگر ندارند، و هرگاه در دل کینه نباشد، ضد آن -که محبّت و دوستی و خیرخواهی برای همدیگر است- جای می‌گیرد. و خداوند کسانی را که پس از اصحاب می‌آیند مؤمن قلمداد نمود،<span class=\"blue\"> چون وقتی می‌گویند:</span> (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿سَبَقُونَا بِٱلۡإِيمَٰنِ﴾</span>) دلیلی است بر اینکه در ایمان آوردن با گذشتگان مشارکت دارند، و در عقاید و ایمان و اصول آن پیرو اصحاب هستند. و این‌ها اهل سنت و جماعت می‌باشند که این وصف کامل فقط بر آنها صدق پیدا می‌کند. خداوند صفت آنها را بیان کرد که به گناهان اقرار می‌نمایند، و از خداوند برای یکدیگر طلب آمرزش می‌کنند، و تلاش می‌نمایند تا در دل‌هایشان نسبت به برادران مؤمن خود کینه‌ای نداشته باشند. آنها که این دعا را می‌کنند، مستلزم آن است یکدیگر را دوست داشته باشند؛ و هرکس چیزی را که برای خود می‌پسندد، برای برادرش نیز بپسندد و در بودن و نبودن برادرش و در زمانی که زنده یا مرده است، خیرخواهش باشد. آیۀ کریمه دلالت می‌نماید که این از جمله حقوق مؤمنان است که بر یکدیگر دارند. سپس دعای مؤمنان را با دو اسم بزرگوار خداوند به پایان برد، دو اسمی که بر کمال رحمت خداوند و شدّت مهربانی‌اش نسبت به بندگان دلالت می‌نمایند. از جمله رحمت و رأفت او این است که به مؤمنان توفیق داده است تا حقوق خدا و بندگانش را به جا بیاورند. پس این گروه‌های سه گانه، گروه‌های این امّت هستند و اینها سزاوار غنیمت می‌باشند و مسلّم است که غنیمت در جایی مصرف می‌شود که مصلحت و منفعت مسلمین در آن باشد.و اینها اهل غنیمت هستند، خداوند ما را از زمرۀ آنان بگرداند!                </div><div lang=\"fa\" class=\"fa \">\n<span class=\"green\">(11)</span> سپس خداوند شگفتی حالت منافقان را بیان می‌کند؛<span class=\"blue\"> آنهایی که به برادران اهل کتاب خود قول می‌دهند که شما را یاری می‌کنیم و به اهل کتاب می‌گویند:</span> (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿لَئِنۡ أُخۡرِجۡتُمۡ لَنَخۡرُجَنَّ مَعَكُمۡ وَلَا نُطِيعُ فِيكُمۡ أَحَدًا أَبَدٗا﴾</span>) هرگاه شما را بیرون کنند، ما هم با شما بیرون خواهیم آمد، و هرکس ما را سرزنش کند یا بترساند تا شما را یاری نکنیم، از او اطاعت نخواهیم کرد. (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَإِن قُوتِلۡتُمۡ لَنَنصُرَنَّكُمۡ وَٱللَّهُ يَشۡهَدُ إِنَّهُمۡ لَكَٰذِبُونَ﴾</span>) و اگر با شما جنگ و پیکار شود، قطعاً شما را یاری خواهیم کرد؛ و خداوند گواهی می‌دهد که آنان در این وعده‌ای که با آن برادران اهل کتاب خود را فریب می‌دهند، دروغگو هستند.                </div><div lang=\"fa\" class=\"fa \">\n<span class=\"green\">(12)</span> و این از آنها بعید نیست، چون دروغ، صفت آنهاست؛ و مکر و فریب و نفاق و بزدلی را همواره به همراه دارند. بنابراین خداوند آنها را تکذیب کرد، و همان‌طور که خداوند خبر داده بود اتفاق افتاد،<span class=\"blue\"> و فرمود:</span> (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿لَئِنۡ أُخۡرِجُواۡ﴾</span>) اگر از خانه‌هایشان بیرون رانده شوند و آواره گردند، (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿لَا يَخۡرُجُونَ مَعَهُمۡ﴾</span>) منافقان به همراه آنها بیرون نخواهند رفت؛ چون وطن خود را دوست دارند و بر جنگیدن و پیکار کردن شکیبا نیستند، و به عهد خود وفادار نمی‌باشند. (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَلَئِن قُوتِلُواۡ لَا يَنصُرُونَهُمۡ﴾</span>) و اگر با آنان کارزار شود به آنان یاری نمی‌رسانند، بلکه ترس و بزدلی بر آنها مستولی می‌گردد و سستی آنها را فرامی‌گیرد و در زمانی که برادرانشان به شدّت به آنها نیاز دارند خوارشان می‌گردانند. (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَلَئِن نَّصَرُوهُمۡ﴾</span>) و به فرض اگر آنها را یاری کنند، (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿لَيُوَلُّنَّ ٱلۡأَدۡبَٰرَ ثُمَّ لَا يُنصَرُونَ﴾</span>) قطعاً پشت خواهند کرد و می‌گریزند. یعنی نمی‌جنگند و پا به فرار می‌گذارند و خداوند هم آنها را یاری نمی‌کند.                </div><div lang=\"fa\" class=\"fa \">\n<span class=\"green\">(13)</span> و آنچه آنها را بر این امر واداشت این است که ترس از شما مؤمنان (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿أَشَدُّ رَهۡبَةٗ فِي صُدُورِهِم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ﴾</span>) در سینه‌های ایشان بیش از هراس آنان از خداست. پس آنها ترسشان از شما بیشتر از ترسشان از خداست و آنها ترس از مخلوقی که اختیار کوچک‌ترین سود و زیانی را برای خودش ندارد بر ترس از آفریننده‌ای که سود و زیان و دادن و ندادن در دست اوست مقدّم داشته‌اند. (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمۡ قَوۡمٞ لَّا يَفۡقَهُونَ﴾</span>) این بدان خاطر است که آنان قومی هستند که مراتب امور و حقایق آن را نمی‌فهمند و عواقب کارها را تصوّر نمی‌کنند. و فهمیدن کامل و درک واقعی این است که ترس از خداوند و امید و محبّت به او بر محبّت و ترس دیگران مقدّم باشد.                </div><div lang=\"fa\" class=\"fa \">\n<span class=\"green\">(14)</span> (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿لَا يُقَٰتِلُونَكُمۡ جَمِيعًا إِلَّا فِي قُرٗى مُّحَصَّنَةٍ أَوۡ مِن وَرَآءِ جُدُرِۢ﴾</span>) آنان به صورت دسته‌جمعی جز در پس دژهای محکم و یا از پشت دیوارها نمی‌جنگند؛ یعنی در پیکار با شما ثابت قدم و مصمّم نخواهند بود مگر اینکه در آبادی و قلعه‌ها پناه بگیرند، و یا اینکه پشت دیوارها باشند، در چنین مواقعی ممکن است که آنها با تکیه بر قلعه‌ها و دیوارهایشان مقاومت کنند، نه اینکه بر اثر شجاعت خودشان جنگیده باشند، و این بزرگ‌ترین مذمّت است. (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿بَأۡسُهُم بَيۡنَهُمۡ شَدِيدٞ﴾</span>) عداوت و جنگشان در میان خودشان سخت است. آنها در جسم و توانایی‌شان آفتی ندارند. بلکه آفتشان این است که ایمانشان ضعیف است و متّحد نیستند.<span class=\"blue\"> بنابراین فرمود:</span> (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿تَحۡسَبُهُمۡ جَمِيعٗا﴾</span>) وقتی آنها را گرد هم می‌بینی، گمان می‌بری که متّحد هستند، (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَقُلُوبُهُمۡ شَتَّىٰ﴾</span>) حال آنکه دل‌هایشان پراکنده است؛ یعنی نسبت به یکدیگر حسد و نفرت دارند. (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمۡ قَوۡمٞ لَّا يَعۡقِلُونَ﴾</span>) آنها چون عقل و خرد ندارند، چنین هستند؛ و اگر عقل ‌داشتند، آنچه را که بهتر است برای خود بر می‌گزیدند و برای خویشتن خوارترین شیوه را نمی‌پسندیدند و متّحد می‌شدند و همدل می‌گشتند و یکدیگر را یاری می‌کردند. و همدیگر را در راستای منافع دینی و دنیوی‌شان کمک می‌نمودند. داستان این خوارشدگان اهل کتاب که خداوند انتقام پیامبرش را از آنها گرفت، و طعم خواری و ذلت را در دنیا به آنها چشاند                </div><div lang=\"fa\" class=\"fa \">\n<span class=\"green\">(15)</span> و از سوی کسانی که به آنها وعده داده بودند یاری‌شان کنند، یاری نشدند، همچون داستان کسانی است که اندکی پیش از اینان بودند.<span class=\"blue\"> آنها کفّار قریش بودند که شیطان کارهایشان را برایشان زیبا جلوه داد و گفت:</span><span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿لَا غَالِبَ لَكُمُ ٱلۡيَوۡمَ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَإِنِّي جَارٞ لَّكُمۡۖ فَلَمَّا تَرَآءَتِ ٱلۡفِئَتَانِ نَكَصَ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيۡهِ وَقَالَ إِنِّي بَرِيٓءٞ مِّنكُمۡ إِنِّيٓ أَرَىٰ مَا لَا تَرَوۡنَ﴾</span> امروز هیچ کس از مردم بر شما چیره نخواهد شد، و من همراه شما هستم. وقتی دو گروه رو در روی هم قرار گرفتند،<span class=\"blue\"> شیطان به عقب فرار کرد و گفت:</span><span class=\"brown\">«من از شما بیزارم، من چیزی می‌بینم که شما نمی‌بینید.»</span> پس آنان فریب خودشان را خوردند، نیز کسانی دیگر آنها را فریب دادند که به آنان سودی نرساندند و عذاب را از آنان دور نکردند تا اینکه با تکبّر و غرور به محل <span class=\"brown\">«بدر»</span> وارد شدند به گمان اینکه آنها به آرزویی که دربارۀ پیامبر و مؤمنان داشتند می‌رسند. امّا خداوند پیامبرش و مؤمنان را بر آنها پیروز گرداند، و بزرگان و سرانشان کشته شدند و تعدادی از آنها به اسارت درآمدند و برخی پا به فرار گذاشتند. از این رو (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿ذَاقُواۡ وَبَالَ أَمۡرِهِمۡ﴾</span>) طعم کارشان و سرانجام شرک و تجاوز خویش را چشیدند. این عذابشان در دنیا بود، (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَلَهُمۡ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٞ﴾</span>) و در آخرت عذاب دردناکی دارند.                </div><div lang=\"fa\"

ٱكۡفُرۡ﴾</span>) مانند مثال شیطان است که به انسان گفت: کافر شو؛ یعنی کفر را برای او زیبا جلوه داد و او را به آن فراخواند. وقتی انسان فریب شیطان را خورد و کافر شد و به بدبختی گرفتار آمد، شیطانی که با او دوست بود و او را به این کارها فرا می‌خواند، به او فایده‌ای نرساند بلکه از او گریزان شد و بیزاری جست و، (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿قَالَ إِنِّي بَرِيٓءٞ مِّنكَ إِنِّيٓ أَخَافُ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ﴾</span>) گفت: من از تو بیزارم، من از خداوند، پروردگار جهانیان می‌ترسم؛ یعنی من برای دور کردن عذاب از تو قدرتی ندارم، و به اندازۀ یک ذره نمی‌توانم به تو سود برسانم.                </div><div lang=\"fa\" class=\"fa \">\n<span class=\"green\">(17)</span> (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿فَكَانَ عَٰقِبَتَهُمَآ﴾</span>) و سرانجام دعوت‌دهنده که شیطان است و دعوت داده شده که انسان است این شد که (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿أَنَّهُمَا فِي ٱلنَّارِ خَٰلِدَيۡنِ فِيهَا﴾</span>) هر دوی آنان در آتش دوزخ هستند و در آن جاودانه خواهند بود.<span class=\"blue\"> همان‌طور که خداوند متعال می‌فرماید:</span><span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿إِنَّمَا يَدۡعُواۡ حِزۡبَهُۥ لِيَكُونُواۡ مِنۡ أَصۡحَٰبِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ﴾</span> بی‌گمان، شیطان گروهش را دعوت می‌کند تا از دوزخیان باشند. (<span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs brown\">﴿وَذَٰلِكَ جَزَٰٓؤُاۡ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ﴾</span>) و این سزای ستمکاران است؛ کسانی که در ستمگری و کفر ورزیدن با همدیگر مشارکت دارند، گرچه در شدت عذاب با یکدیگر متفاوت هستند. و این عادت و شیوۀ شیطان با همۀ دوستانش می‌باشد؛ او آنها را فرامی‌خواند و با حیله و فریب، آنها را به سوی آنچه که به زیانشان است می‌کشاند تا اینکه در دام می‌افتند و اسباب هلاکت و نابودی، آنها را فرامی‌گیرد. در این هنگام از آنها بیزاری می‌جوید و از آنها دست می‌کشد. و کسی که از شیطان اطاعت کند، قابل سرزنش است؛ چون خداوند آدمی را از او برحذر داشته و انسان‌ها را از اهداف و منظور شیطان آگاه کرده است. پس کسی که اقدام به اطاعت از او ‌نماید، از روی بینش مرتکب گناه می‌شود و چنین کسی عذری ندارد.                </div>"

صلى الله عليه وسلم - ليستعين بهم فى دفع دية لقتيلين قتلهما بعض المسلمين خطأ ، فاستقبلوه استقبالا حسنا ، وأظهروا له - صلى الله عليه وسلم - استعدادهم للمساعدة فيما يطلبه خطأ ، فاستقبلوه استقبالا حسنا ، وأظهروا له - صلى الله عليه وسلم - استعدادهم للمساعدة فيما يطلبه منهم ، ثم خلا بعضهم ببعض وقالوا : إنكم لن تجدوا الرجل على مثل حاله هذه ، فمن منكم يصعد إلى أعلى هذا البيت الذى يجلس تحته محمد - صلى الله عليه وسلم - فيلقى عليه حجرا فيريحنا منه .فتعهد واحد منهم بذلك ، وقبل أن يتم فعله ، نزل جبريل - عليه السلام - على النبى - صلى الله عليه وسلم - فأخبره بما أضمره اليهود من غدر وخيانة فرجع - صلى الله عليه وسلم - إلى المدينة - وأخبر أصحابه بما أضمره له يهود بنى النضير ، ونزل قوله - تعالى - : ( يَا أَيُّهَآ الذين آمَنُواْ اذكروا نِعْمَتَ الله عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ هَمَّ قَوْمٌ أَن يَبْسُطُواْ إِلَيْكُمْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ فَكَفَّ أَيْدِيَهُمْ عَنكُمْ واتقوا الله وَعَلَى الله فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ المؤمنون ) ثم أمر النبى - صلى الله عليه وسلم - أصحابه أن يستعدوا لحصار بنى النضير ، وتأديبهم على غدرهم . . . فحاصرهم المؤمنون بضعا وعشرين ليلة ، وانتهى الأمر بإجلائهم ، عن المدينة ، فمنهم من ذهب إلى خبير ، ومنهم من ذهب إلى غيرها .واللام فى قوله - تعالى - : ( لأَوَّلِ الحشر ) متعلقة بأخرج ، والحشر : الجمع ، يقال : حشر القائد جنده إذا جمعهم ، ومنه قوله - تعالى - : ( وَحُشِرَ لِسْلَيْمَانَ جُنُودُهُ مِنَ الجن والإنس والطير فَهُمْ يُوزَعُونَ ) أى : هو - سبحانه - الذى أخرج - بقدرته - الذين كفروا من أهل الكتاب من ديارهم ، وهم يهود بنى النضير عند مبدا الحشر المقدر لهم فى علمه ، بأن مكنكم - أيها المؤمنون - من محاصرتهم وجمعهم فى مكان واحد ، ثم طردهم من المدينة المنورة إلى أماكن أخرى ، بسبب غدرهم وسوء صنيعهم .قال صاحب الكشاف : اللام فى قوله : ( لأَوَّلِ الحشر ) تتعلق بأخرج ، وهى مثل اللام فى قوله : ( ياليتني قَدَّمْتُ لِحَيَاتِي ) وفى قولك : جئته لوقت كذا . . .والمعنى : أخرج الذين كفروا عند أول الحشر . ومعنى أول الحشر : أن هذا أول حشرهم إلى الشام ، وكانوا من سبط لم يصبهم جلاء قط . . . أو المعنى : هذا أول حشرهم ، وآخر حشرهم : إجلاء عمر - رضى الله عنه - لهم من خيبر إلى الشام .وقيل معناه : أخرجهم من ديارهم لأول ما حشر لقتالهم ، لأنه أول قتال قاتلهم رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - .وقصر - سبحانه - إخراجهم عليه فقال : هو الذى أخرج الذين كفروا ، مع أن المسلمين قد اشتركوا فى إخراجهم عن طريق محاصرتهم؛ للإشعار بأن السبب الحقيقى فى إخراجهم من ديارهم ، هو ما قذفه الله - تعالى - فى قلوبهم من الرعب . . . أما محاصرة المؤمنين لهم فهى أسباب فرعية ، قد تؤدى إلى أخراجهم ، وقد لا تؤدى ، وللإشعار - أيضا - بأن كل شىء إنما هو بقضاء الله وقدره .ووصفهم - سبحانه - بالكفر وبأنهم من أهل الكتاب ، للتشنيع عليهم وزيادة مذمتهم ، حيث إنهم جمعوا بين رذيلتين : رذيلة الكفر بالحق ، ورذيلة عدم العلم بكتابهم الذى أمر باتباع الرسول - صلى الله عليه وسلم - الذى يجدونه مكتوبا عندهم فى التوراة والإنجيل ، والذى يأمرهم بالمعروف ، وينهاهم عن المنكر .و \" من \" فى قوله - تعالى - : ( مِنْ أَهْلِ الكتاب ) للبيان ، حتى لا يظن بأن المراد بالذين كفروا هنا ، مشركو قريش ، وإن كان الجميع يشتركون فى الكفر والفسوق والعصيان .وقوله - تعالى - : ( مَا ظَنَنتُمْ أَن يَخْرُجُواْ . . . ) تذكير للمؤمنين بنعم الله - تعالى - عليهم .أى : ما ظننتم - أيها المؤمنون - أن يهود بنى النضير سيخرجون من ديارهم بتلك السهولة ، وذلك لتملكهم لألوان من القوة ، كقوة السلاح ، وكثرة العدد ، ووجود من يحميهم ممن يسكنون معكم فى المدينة ، وهم حلفاؤهم من بنى قومهم ، كبنى قريظة وغيرهم ، ومن غير بنى قومهم كالمنافقين الذين وعدوهم ومنوهم .وقوله : ( وظنوا أَنَّهُمْ مَّانِعَتُهُمْ حُصُونُهُم مِّنَ الله ) معطوف على ما قبله .أى : أنتم - أيها المؤمنون - ظننتم أن اليهود لن يخرجوا من ديارهم لما معهم من قوة ، وهم - أيضا - ظنوا أن حصونهم ستمنع بأس الله عنهم ، وأنها ستحول بينهم وبين خروجهم منها ، ونَصْرِكم عليهم .وقوله - سبحانه - : ( فَأَتَاهُمُ الله مِنْ حَيْثُ لَمْ يَحْتَسِبُواْ وَقَذَفَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الرعب . . ) متفرع عن الظن السابق ، الذى ظنه المؤمنون ، والذى ظنه أعداؤهم وهم بنو النضير .أى : أنتم ظننتم أنهم لن يخرجوا من ديارهم ، وهم ظنوا - أيضا - أن حصونهم ستمنعهم من نصركم عليهم ، فكانت النتيجة أن أتاهم بأس الله وعقابه من حيث لم يحتسبوا ومن حيث لم يخطر ببال ، بأن قذف فى قلوبهم الرعب والفزع فخرجوا من حصونهم التى تمنعوا بها ، ومن ديارهم التى سكنوها زمنا طويلا صاغرين أذلاء .والتعبير بقوله : ( مِنْ حَيْثُ لَمْ يَحْتَسِبُواْ ) إشارة إلى أن ما نزل بهم من هزيمة ، لم يكونوا يتوقعونها أصلا ، إذ الاحتساب مبالغة فى الحسبان ، أى : أتاهم عقاب الله - تعالى - من المكان الذى كانوا يعتقدون أمانهم فيه ، وفى زمان لم يكونوا أصلا يتوقعون حلول هزيمتهم عنده .وعبر - بحانه - بالقذف ، لأنه كناية عن الرمى بقوة وعنف وسرعة . والرعب : شدة الخوف والفزع ، وأصله : الامتلاء . تقول : رعبت الحوض إذا ملأته .أى : وقذف - سبحانه - فى قلوبهم الرعب الذى ملأها بالجزع والفزع فاستسلموا بسبب ذلك لما حكم به الرسول - صلى الله عليه وسلم - عليهم .ثم ين - سبحانه - ما حدث منهم خلال جلائهم فقال : ( يُخْرِبُونَ بُيُوتَهُمْ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَيْدِي المؤمنين فاعتبروا ياأولي الأبصار ) والتخريب : إسقاط البناء وهدمه أو إفساده .أى : أن هؤلاء اليهود ، بلغ من سوء نيتهم ، ومن اضطراب أمرهم ، أنهم عندما أجمعوا أمرهم على الرحيل عن المدينة ، أخذوا يخربون بيوتهم بأيديهم ، عن طريق إسقاط بنائها ، وهدم السليم منها ، وإزالة ما اشتملت عليه من أبواب وغيرها . . . حتى لا ينتفع المسلمون بها من بعدهم . .وأخذوا يخربونها - أيضا - بأيدى المؤمنين ، أى : بسبب أن المؤمنين كانوا يزيلون من طريقهم كل عقبة حتى يقتحموا عليهم ديارهم ، فترتب على ذلك أن هدموا بعض بيوت بنى النضير من الخارج ، ليستطيعوا التمكن منهم .قال صاحب الكشاف : ما معنى تخريبهم لها بأيدى المؤمنين؟ قلت : لما عرَّضوهم لذلك ، وكانوا السبب فيه . فكأنهم أمروهم به ، وكلفوهم إياه . .أى : أن يهود بنى النضير بسبب تحصنهم فى ديارهم ، ومحاولتهم عدم النزول على حكم الرسول - صلى الله عليه وسلم - حملوا المؤمنين على تخريب هذه الحصون من الخارج ، ليدخلوا عليهم . . .والخطاب فى قوله - تعالى - : ( فاعتبروا ياأولي الأبصار ) لكل من يصلح له .قال الجمل فى حاشيته : والاعتبار مأخوذ من العبور والمجاوزة من شىء إلى شىء ، ولهذا سميت العبرة عبرة ، لأنها تنتقل من العين إلى الخد . وسمى علم التعبير بذلك ، لأن صاحبه ينتقل من المتخيل إلى المعقول ، وسميت الألفاظ عبارات ، لأنها تنقل المعانى من لسان القائل إلى عقل المستمع ، ويقال : السعيد من اعتبر بغيره ، لأنه ينتقل بواسطه عقله من حال ذلك الغير إلى حال نفسه .ولهذا قال القشيرى : الاعتبار هو النظر فى حقائق الأشياء ، وجهات دلالتها ، ليعرف بالنظر فيها شىء آخر .أى : إذا كان الأمر كان بينا لكم - أيها الناس - ، فاعتبروا واتعظوا يا أصحاب العقول السليمة ، والعيون الناظرة ، بما جرى لهؤلاء اليهود ، حيث دبر الله - تعالى - أمر إخراجهم من ديارهم تدبيرا حكيما ، ونصر المؤمنين عليهم بأيسر طريق ، وجعل ديارهم من بعدهم ، خير عبرة وعظة لكل ذى بصر ، فقد خلفوها من بعدهم شاهد صدق على أن الغدر نهايته الخسران . . . وعلى أن النصر إنما هو لمن اتبع الصدق والوفاء بالعهد . . .قال الآلوسى : واشتهر الاستدلال بهذه الجملة ، على مشروعية العمل بالقياس الشرعى ، قالوا : لأنه - تعالى - أمر فيها بالاعتبار ، وهو العبور والانتقال من الشىء إلى غيره ، وذلك متحقق فى القياس ، إذ فيه نقل الحكم من الأصل إلى الفرع ."

They were from the Jews: the people of the Torah. After they had broken their treaty and sided with the idolaters against the Messenger, He exiled them towards the Levant. O believers! You did not think they would leave their homes because of the might and strength they possessed, and they themselves thought that their fortresses they had fortified would protect them from the might of Allah and His punishment. Then, the might of Allah came upon them in a manner they did not anticipate, when He commanded His Messenger to fight them and exile them from their homes. Allah also put extreme fear into their hearts, and they began demolishing their homes with their own hands from the inside so that the believers could not take advantage of them, while the Muslims demolished them from the outside. O people of insight! So take heed of what befell them due to their disbelief and do not be like them, in case you get the same requital as they did, and face the same punishment they faced."

وهم رهط من اليهود من ذرية هارون عليه السلام ، نزلوا المدينة في فتن بني إسرائيل انتظارا لمحمد صلى الله عليه وسلم ، وكان من أمرهم ما نص الله عليه .الثانية : قوله تعالى : لأول الحشر ؛ الحشر الجمع ; وهو على أربعة أوجه : حشران في الدنيا وحشران في الآخرة ; أما الذي في الدنيا فقوله تعالى : هو الذي أخرج الذين كفروا من أهل الكتاب من ديارهم لأول الحشر قال الزهري : كانوا من سبط لم يصبهم جلاء ، وكان الله عز وجل قد كتب عليهم الجلاء ; فلولا ذلك لعذبهم في الدنيا ، وكان أول حشر حشروا في الدنيا إلى الشام . قال ابن عباس وعكرمة : من شك أن المحشر في الشام فليقرأ هذه [ ص: 5 ] الآية ، وأن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال لهم : \" اخرجوا \" . قالوا : إلى أين ؟ قال : \" إلى أرض المحشر \" . قال قتادة : هذا أول المحشر . قال ابن عباس : هم أول من حشر من أهل الكتاب وأخرج من دياره . وقيل : إنهم أخرجوا إلى خيبر ، وأن معنى \" لأول الحشر \" إخراجهم من حصونهم إلى خيبر ، وآخره إخراج عمر رضي الله عنه إياهم من خيبر إلى نجد وأذرعات . وقيل تيماء وأريحاء ، وذلك بكفرهم ونقض عهدهم .وأما الحشر الثاني : فحشرهم قرب القيامة . قال قتادة : تأتي نار تحشر الناس من المشرق إلى المغرب ، تبيت معهم حيث باتوا ، وتقيل معهم حيث قالوا ، وتأكل منهم من تخلف . وهذا ثابت في الصحيح ، وقد ذكرناه في ( كتاب التذكرة ) . ونحوه روى ابن وهب عن مالك قال : قلت لمالك هو جلاؤهم من ديارهم ؟ فقال لي : الحشر يوم القيامة حشر اليهود . قال : وأجلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم اليهود إلى خيبر حين سئلوا عن المال فكتموه ; فاستحلهم بذلك . قال ابن العربي : للحشر أول ووسط وآخر ; فالأول إجلاء بني النضير ، والأوسط إجلاء خيبر ، والآخر حشر يوم القيامة . وعن الحسن : هم بنو قريظة . وخالفه بقية المفسرين وقالوا : بنو قريظة ما حشروا ولكنهم قتلوا . حكاه الثعلبي .الثالثة : قال الكيا الطبري : ومصالحة أهل الحرب على الجلاء من ديارهم من غير شيء لا يجوز الآن ، وإنما كان ذلك في أول الإسلام ثم نسخ . والآن فلا بد من قتالهم أو سبيهم أو ضرب الجزية عليهم .قوله تعالى : ما ظننتم أن يخرجوا يريد لعظم أمر اليهود ومنعتهم وقوتهم في صدور المسلمين ، واجتماع كلمتهم .وظنوا أنهم مانعتهم حصونهم قيل : هي الوطيح والنطاة والسلالم والكتيبة .من الله أي من أمره . وكانوا أهل حلقة - أي سلاح كثير - وحصون منيعة ; فلم يمنعهم شيء منها .فأتاهم الله أي أمره وعذابه .من حيث لم يحتسبوا أي لم يظنوا . وقيل : من حيث لم يعلموا . وقيل : من حيث لم يحتسبوا بقتل كعب بن الأشرف ; قاله ابن جريج والسدي وأبو صالح .قوله تعالى : وقذف في قلوبهم الرعب بقتل سيدهم كعب بن الأشرف ; وكان الذي قتله هو محمد بن مسلمة وأبو نائلة سلكان بن سلامة بن وقش - وكان أخا كعب بن الأشرف من الرضاعة - وعباد بن بشر بن وقش ، والحارث بن أوس بن معاذ ، وأبو عبس بن جبر . وخبره [ ص: 6 ] مشهور في السيرة . وفي الصحيح أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : \" نصرت بالرعب بين يدي مسيرة شهر \" فكيف لا ينصر به مسيرة ميل من المدينة إلى محلة بني النضير . وهذه خصيصى لمحمد صلى الله عليه وسلم دون غيره .قوله تعالى : يخربون بيوتهم قراءة العامة بالتخفيف من أخرب ; أي يهدمون . وقرأ السلمي والحسن ونصر بن عاصم وأبو العالية وقتادة وأبو عمرو \" يخربون \" بالتشديد من التخريب . قال أبو عمرو : إنما اخترت التشديد لأن الإخراب ترك الشيء خرابا بغير ساكن ، وبنو النضر لم يتركوها خرابا وإنما خربوها بالهدم .يؤيده قوله تعالى : بأيديهم وأيدي المؤمنين وقال آخرون : التخريب والإخراب بمعنى واحد ، والتشديد بمعنى التكثير . وحكى سيبويه : أن معنى فعلت وأفعلت يتعاقبان ; نحو أخربته وخربته وأفرحته وفرحته . واختار أبو عبيد وأبو حاتم الأولى . قال قتادة والضحاك : كان المؤمنون يخربون من خارج ليدخلوا ، واليهود يخربون من داخل ليبنوا به ما خرب من حصنهم . فروي أنهم صالحوا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم على ألا يكونوا عليه ولا له ; فلما ظهر يوم بدر قالوا : هو النبي الذي نعت في التوراة ، فلا ترد له راية . فلما هزم المسلمون يوم أحد ارتابوا ونكثوا ، فخرج كعب بن الأشرف في أربعين راكبا إلى مكة ، فحالفوا عليه قريشا عند الكعبة ، فأمر عليه السلام محمد بن مسلمة الأنصاري فقتل كعبا غيلة ، ثم صبحهم بالكتائب ; فقال لهم : اخرجوا من المدينة . فقالوا : الموت أحب إلينا من ذلك ; فتنادوا بالحرب . وقيل : استمهلوا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم عشرة أيام ليتجهزوا للخروج ، فدس إليهم عبد الله بن أبي المنافق وأصحابه : لا تخرجوا من الحصن ، فإن قاتلوكم فنحن معكم لا نخذلكم ، ولئن أخرجتم لنخرجن معكم . فدربوا على الأزقة وحصنوها إحدى وعشرين ليلة ، فلما قذف الله في قلوبهم الرعب وأيسوا من نصر المنافقين طلبوا الصلح ; فأبى عليهم إلا الجلاء ; على ما يأتي بيانه . وقال الزهري وابن زيد وعروة بن الزبير : لما صالحهم النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم على أن لهم ما أقلت الإبل ; كانوا يستحسنون الخشبة والعمود فيهدمون بيوتهم ويحملون ذلك على إبلهم ويخرب المؤمنون باقيها . وعن ابن زيد أيضا : كانوا يخربونها لئلا يسكنها [ ص: 7 ] المسلمون بعدهم . وقال ابن عباس : كانوا كلما ظهر المسلمون على دار من دورهم هدموها ليتسع موضع القتال ، وهم ينقبون دورهم من أدبارها إلى التي بعدها ليتحصنوا فيها ، ويرموا بالتي أخرجوا منها المسلمين . وقيل : ليسدوا بها أزقتهم . وقال عكرمة بأيديهم في إخراب دواخلها وما فيها لئلا يأخذه المسلمون . و أيدي المؤمنين في إخراب ظاهرها ليصلوا بذلك إليهم . قال عكرمة : كانت منازلهم مزخرفة فحسدوا المسلمين أن يسكنوها ، فخربوها من داخل وخربها المسلمون من خارج . وقيل : يخربون بيوتهم بنقض المواعدة ، وأيدي المؤمنين بالمقاتلة ; قاله الزهري أيضا . وقال أبو عمرو بن العلاء \" بأيديهم \" في تركهم لها . و \" أيدي المؤمنين \" في إجلائهم عنها . قال ابن العربي : التناول للإفساد إذا كان باليد كان حقيقة ، وإذا كان بنقض العهد كان مجازا ; إلا أن قول الزهري في المجاز أمثل من قول أبي عمرو بن العلاء .قوله تعالى : \" فاعتبروا يا أولي \" أي اتعظوا يا أصحاب العقول والألباب . وقيل : يا من عاين ذلك ببصره ; فهو جمع للبصر . ومن جملة الاعتبار هنا أنهم اعتصموا بالحصون من الله فأنزلهم الله منها . ومن وجوهه : أنه سلط عليهم من كان ينصرهم . ومن وجوهه أيضا : أنهم هدموا أموالهم بأيديهم . ومن لم يعتبر بغيره اعتبر في نفسه . وفي الأمثال الصحيحة : \" السعيد من وعظ بغيره \" ."

            "text": "Он даровал победу Своему посланнику, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, над неверующими людьми Писания и изгнал племя Надыр из облюбованных ими жилищ и мест за их вероломство и измену. Иудеи собрались и покинули Медину, но это было лишь первым сбором и изгнанием из тех, что им предстояло пережить при жизни Пророка Мухаммада, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует. Кораническое откровение указывало на то, что и в будущем иудеев ожидали сборы и изгнания. И это предсказание сбылось, когда сначала Пророк Мухаммад, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, изгнал иудеев из Хейбара, а затем Умар б. аль-Хаттаб велел оставшимся иудеям покинуть земли этого поселения. О мусульмане! Вы даже не предполагали, что они уйдут из родных домов, потому что иудейские поселения были хорошо укреплены и неприступны, да и сами иудеи за крепостными стенами были довольно сильны. Они надеялись, что крепости защитят их от Аллаха, и полагались на собственную мощь. Они были обольщены собой и считали, что никто не сможет одолеть их. Но Аллах всемогущ и способен одолеть любое воинство. Ни крепости, ни башни не способны защитить людей от Него. В такой борьбе ни мощь, ни оборона не могут принести никакой пользы. Всевышний Аллах настиг их оттуда, откуда они и не ожидали, и поселил в их сердцах страх. Страх и ужас - это величайшее оружие Аллаха, которое нельзя одолеть ни числом, ни умением, ни мощью, ни силой. Иудеи предполагали, что брешью в их обороне могут стать крепости, за которыми они чувствовали себя спокойно. Всякий же, кто полагается на что-либо, помимо Аллаха, непременно лишится поддержки Господа. И всякий, кто предается кому-либо, помимо Аллаха, лишь взваливает на свои плечи тяжелое бремя. Поэтому удар с небес поразил самое уязвимое место иудеев - их сердца. А ведь именно сердца являются местом, где покоятся стойкость и терпение, упадок духа и слабость. И вот развеялись мощь и сила иудеев, а их место заняли слабость, отчаяние и трусость, от которых они уже не могли избавиться. Именно это стало причиной их поражения. Иудеи сами разрушали свои дома и подстрекали к этому верующих. Они поступали так, потому что посланник Аллаха, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, позволил им взять с собой лишь то, что смогут унести верблюды. Тогда они решили поломать крыши своих домов, которые некогда берегли и которыми любовались, и стали подстрекать верующих к тому, чтобы они тоже разрушали их дома и крепости. Они сами были виноваты в своем несчастии и вредили только самим себе. В этом назидание для всех, кто обладает проницательным умом и здравым рассудком. Описанное выше событие наглядно свидетельствует о том, как Аллах поступает с противниками истины и рабами низменных страстей. Могущество не принесло пользы иудеям, а укрепления не сумели защитить их, когда Всевышний Аллах подверг их наказанию за содеянные грехи. Однако смысл этого назидания очень велик и не ограничивается конкретным случаем. Обсуждаемое нами откровение подразумевает повеление размышлять над этим назиданием, а следовательно, проводить аналогию между схожими фактами, задумываться над вытекающими из них законами и размышлять над их смыслом и мудростью. Благодаря этому совершенствуется человеческий ум, развивается сознание, усиливается вера и достигается подлинное представление о сути вещей. Затем Всевышний Аллах поведал о том, что иудеи не получили сполна должного наказания и что их страдания были облегчены."

            "text": "<p>(1) The original word used in the text is 'hashr' which means 'gathering' or 'mustering' and after which this Surah is named. In the present context, it may be interpreted in two different ways. One, that it refers to the gathering of the Muslims who ordered the Jews to leave Madinah due to their constant conspiracies and breaches of the treaty they had with the Muslims. According to this interpretation, the verse means that the Jews of Bani Nadir were made to leave the city at the first gathering of the Muslims without fighting and without any further attempt to attack them. The second interpretation is that it refers to the gathering of the Jews for the purpose of emigration. In this case the verse indicates that it was their first exile before which they did not face such a situation. It has another subtle indication to the fact that this was their first exile which will be followed by another one, i.e. the exile faced by the Jews in the days of Sayyidna ` Umar . (Muhammad Taqi Usmani)</p><p>لِأَوَّلِ الْحَشْرِ‌ (...at the time of the first gathering...59:2). The word hashr means 'to rise'. One reason for referring to it as the 'first mustering' is given by Maulana Thanawi (رح) in his Tafsir. They were settled at one place since ancient times. This event of banishment took place for the first time in their life. The second reason could be that all the non-Muslims of the Arabian peninsula would have to be evacuated in future, so that the peninsula might become a strong fortress of Islam. As a result, a second banishment was to take place at some later time. This happened during the caliphate of ` Umar ؓ ، the Holy Prophet's Second Successor. He banished all the Jews who had settled in Khaibar. He ordered all the Jews to leave the Arabian peninsula. From this point of view, Banu Nadir's banishment is the 'first banishment' and the 'second banishment' took place in the time of Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ .</p><p>فَأَتَاهُمُ اللَّـهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَمْ يَحْتَسِبُوا (...But Allah came to them from where they did not expect... 59:2). The phrase 'Allah came' means 'the command of Allah and His obedient angels came'.</p><p>يُخْرِ‌بُونَ بُيُوتَهُم بِأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَيْدِي الْمُؤْمِنِينَ (...they were spoiling their homes with their own hands and with the hands of the believers....59:2) Banu Nadir had spoiled their houses by removing their doors and shutters. 'Spoiling their homes with the hands of the believers' means that when the Jews locked themselves up in their fortresses, the Muslims destroyed the trees and homes outside the fortresses to make them surrender.</p>"

Ces gens étaient des juifs adeptes de la Torah qui, après avoir violé leur engagement et s’être ligué avec les mécréants contre le Prophète, ont été expulsés vers le Levant. Ô croyants, vous ne pensiez pas qu’ils seraient expulsés de leurs demeures, en raison de leur puissance. Eux-mêmes pensaient que les forteresses qu’ils avaient bâties les protègeraient de la colère et de la punition d’Allah. Seulement, la colère d’Allah s’est abattue sur eux d’où ils ne s’y attendaient pas lorsqu’Il ordonna à Son Messager de les combattre et de les expulser de leurs demeures. Allah introduisit alors une immense terreur dans leurs cœurs, leur faisant détruire leurs demeures de leurs propres mains de l’intérieur afin que les musulmans n’en tirent pas profit, tandis que les musulmans les détruisaient de l’extérieur. Tirez donc des enseignements, ô vous qui êtes pourvus d’une vision, de ce qu’il advint d’eux pour leur mécréance. Ne soyez donc pas comme eux afin de ne pas mériter leur punition."

(2){ هُوَ الذى أَخْرَجَ الذين كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ الكتاب مِن ديارهم لاَِوَّلِ الحَشْرِ مَا ظَنَنتُمْ أَن يَخرُجُواْ } .يجوز أن تجعل جملة { هو الذي أخرج الذين كفروا } إلى آخرها استئنافاً ابتدائياً لقصد إجراء هذا التمجيد على اسم الجلالة لما يتضمنه من باهر تقديره ، ولِمَا يؤذن به ذلك من التعريض بوجوب شكره على ذلك الإِخراج العجيب .ويجوز أن تجعل علة لما تضمنه الخبر عن تسبيح ما في السماوات وما في الأرض من التذكير للمؤمنين والتعريض بأهل الكتاب والمنافقين الذين هم فريقان مما في الأرض فإن القصة التي تضمنتها فاتحة السورة من أهل أحوالهما .ويجوز أن تجعل مبينة لجملة { وهو العزيز الحكيم } [ الحشر : 1 ] لأن هذا التسخير العظيم من آثار عزّه وحكمته .وعلى كل الوجوه فهو تذكير بنعمة الله على المسلمين وإيماء إلى أن يشكروا الله على ذلك وتمهيد للمقصود من السورة وهو قسمة أموال بني النضير .وتعريف جزأي الجملة بالضمير والموصول يفيد قصر صفة إخراج الذين كفروا من ديارهم عليه تعالى وهو قصر ادعائي لعدم الاعتداد بسعي المؤمنين في ذلك الإِخراج ومعالجتهم بعض أسبابه كتخريب ديار بني النضير .ولذلك فَجملة { ما ظننتم أن يخرجوا } تتنزل منزلة التعليل لجملة القصر .وجملة { وظنوا أنهم مانعتهم حصونهم } عطف على العلة ، أي وهم ظنوا أن المسلمين لا يغلبونهم . وإنما لم يقل : وظنوا أن لا يُخرَجوا . مع أن الكلام على خروجهم ، من قوله تعالى : { هو الذي أخرج الذين كفروا } فعدل عنه إلى { وظنوا أنهم مانعتهم حصونهم } أي مانعتهم من إخراجهم استغناء عن ذكر المظنون بذكر علة الظن . والتقدير : وظنوا أن لا يخرجوا لأنهم تمنعهم حصونهم ، أي ظنوا ظناً قوياً معتمدين على حصونهم .والمراد ب { الذين كفروا من أهل الكتاب } بنو النضير ( بوزن أمير ) وهم قبيلة من اليهود استوطنوا بلاد العرب هم وبنو عمهم قُريظة ، ويهودُ خَيبر ، وكلهم من ذرية هَارون عليْه السلام وكان يقال لبني النضير وبني قريظة : الكاهنان لأن كل فريق منهما من ذرية هارون وهو كاهن الملة الإسرائيلية ، والكهانة : حفظ أمور الديانة بيده ويد أعقابه .وقصة استيطانهم بلاد العرب أن موسى عليه السلام كان أرسل طائفة من أسلافهم لقتال العماليق المجاورين للشام وأرض العرب فقصَّروا في قتالهم وتوفي موسى قريباً من ذلك . فلما علموا بوفاة موسى رجعوا على أعقابهم إلى ديار إسرائيل في أريحَا فقال لهم قومهم : أنتم عصيتم أمر موسى فلا تدخلوا بلادنا ، فخرجوا إلى جزيرة العرب وأقاموا لأنفسهم قُرى حول يثرب ( المدينة ) وبنوا لأنفسهم حصُوناً وقرية سَموها الزَّهرة . وكانت حصونهم خمسة سيأتي ذكر أسمائها في آخر تفسير الآية ، وصاروا أهل زرع وأموال . وكان فيهم أهل الثراء مثل السموأل بن عَادِيا ، وكَعب بن الأشرف ، وابن أبي الحُقَيق ، وكان بينهم وبين الأوس والخزرج حِلف ومعاملة ، فكان من بطون أولئك اليهود بنو النضير وقريظة وخيبر .ووسموا ب { الذين كفروا } لأنهم كفروا بمحمد صلى الله عليه وسلم تسجيلاً عليهم بهذا الوصف الذميم وقد وُصفوا ب { الذين كفروا } في قوله تعالى : { ولما جاءهم كتاب من عند الله مصدق لما معهم وكانوا من قبل يستفتحون على الذين كفروا فلما جاءهم ما عرفوا كفروا به فلعنة الله على الكافرين } [ البقرة : 89 ] إلى قوله : { عذاب مهين } في سورة [ البقرة : 90 ] .وعليه فحرف من } في قوله : { من أهل الكتاب } بيانية لأن المراد بأهل الكتاب هنا خصوص اليهود أي الذين كفروا برسالة محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم وهم أهل الكتاب وأراد بهم اليهود ، فوصفوا ب { من أهل الكتاب } لئلا يظن أن المراد ب { الذين كفروا } المشركون بمكة أو بقية المشركين بالمدينة فيُظنّ أن الكلام وعيد .وتفصيل القصة التي أشارت إليها الآية على ما ذكره جمهور أهل التفسير . أن بني النضير لما هاجر المسلمون إلى المدينة جاؤوا فصالحوا النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم على أن لا يكونوا عليه ولا له ، ويقال : إن مصالحتهم كانت عقبَ وقعة بَدر لمَّا غلَب المسلمون المشركين لأنهم توسّموا أنه لا تهزم لهم راية ، فلما غُلب المسلمون يوم أُحد نكثوا عهدهم وراموا مصالحة المشركين بمكة ، إذ كانوا قد قعدوا عن نصرتهم يوم بدر ( كدأب اليهود في موالاة القوي ) فخرج كعب بن الأشرف وهو سيد بني النضير في أربعين راكباً إلى مكة فحَالفوا المشركين عند الكعبة على أن يكونوا عوناً لهم على مقاتلة المسلمين ، فلما أُوحي إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بذلك أمرَ محمدَ بن مسلمة أن يقتل كعب بن الأشرف فقتله غيلة في حصنه في قصة مذكورة في كتب السنة والسير .وذكر ابن إسحاق سبباً آخر وهو أنه لما انقضت وقعة بئر معونة في صفر سنة أربع كان عَمرو بن أمية الضَّمْري أسيراً عند المشركين فأطلقه عامر بن الطفيل . فلما كان راجعاً إلى المدينة أقبل رجلان من بني عامر وكان لقومهما عقد مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ونزلا مع عمرو بن أمية ، فلما ناما عدا عليهما فقتلهما وهو يحسب أنه يثأر بهما من بني عامر الذين قتلوا أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ببئر معونة ، ولما قدم عمرو بن أمية أخبر رسولَ الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بما فعل فقال له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم « لقد قتلت قتيلين ولآدِيَنَّهُمَا » ، وخرج رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى بني النضير يستعينهم في دية ذينك القتيلين إذ كان بين بني النضير وبين بني عامر حِلف ، وأضمر بنو النضير الغدر برسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وأطلعه الله عليه فأمر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم المسلمين بالتهيّؤ لحربهم .ثم أمر النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم المسلمين بالسيْر إليهم في ربيع الأول سنة أربع من الهجرة فسار إليهم هو والمسلمون وأمرهم بأن يَخرجوا من قريتهم فامتنعوا وتنادوا إلى الحرب ودسّ إليهم عبد الله بنُ أُبيّ ابنُ سلول أن لا يخرجوا من قريتهم وقال : إنْ قاتلَكم المسلمون فنحن معكم ولننصُرنَّكم وإن أخرجتم لَنَخُرجَنّ معكم فَدَرِّبُوا على الأزقة ( أي سُدُّوا منافذ بعضها لبعض ليكون كلّ درب منها صالحاً للمدافعة ) وحصِّنوها ، ووعدهم أن معه ألفين من قومه وغيرهم ، وأن معهم قريظة وحلفاءهم من غطفان من العرب فحاصرهم النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وانتظروا عبد الله بن أُبيّ ابن سلول وقريظة وغطفان أن يقدموا إليهم ليردوا عنهم جيش المسلمين فلما رأوا أنهم لم ينجدوهم قذف الله في قلوبهم الرعب فطلبوا من النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم الصلح فأبى إلا الجلاء عن ديارهم وتشارطوا على أن يخرجوا ويَحملَ كلّ ثلاثة أبيات منهم حِمْل بعير مما شاؤوا من متاعهم ، فجعلوا يخرّبون بيوتهم ليحملوا معهم ما ينتفعون به من الخشب والأبواب .فخرجوا فمنهم من لحق بخيبر ، وقليل منهم لحقوا ببلاد الشام في مدن ( أريحا ) وأذرعات من أرض الشام وخرج قليل منهم إلى الحِيرة .واللام في قوله : { لأول الحشر } لام التوقيت وهي التي تدخل على أول الزمان المجعول ظرفاً لعمللٍ مثل قوله تعالى : { يقول يا ليتني قدمت لحياتي } [ الفجر : 24 ] أي من وقت حياتي . وقولهم : كتب ليوم كذا . وهي بمعنى ( عند ) . فالمعنى أنه أخرجهم عند مبدأ الحشر المقدر لهم ، وهذا إيماء إلى أن الله قَدر أن يخرجوا من جميع ديارهم في بلاد العرب . وهذا التقدير أمر به النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم كما سيأتي . فالتعريف في { الحشر } تعريف العهد .والحشر : جمع ناس في مكان قال تعالى : { وابعث في المدائن حاشرين يأتوك بكل سحّار عليم } [ الشعراء : 36 - 37 ] .والمراد به هنا : حشر يهود جزيرة العرب إلى أرض غيرها ، أي جمْعهم للخروج ، وهو بهذا المعنى يرادف الجلاء إذا كان الجلاء لجماعة عظيمة تُجمع من متفرق ديار البلاد .وليس المراد به : حشر يوم القيامة إذ لا مناسبة له هنا ولا يلائم ذكر لفظ «أول» لأن أول كل شيء إنما يكون متحد النوع مع ما أضيف هو إليه .وعن الحسن : أنه حمل الآية على حشر القيامة وركّبوا على ذلك أوهاماً في أن حشر القيامة يكون بأرض الشام وقد سبق أن ابن عباس احترز من هذا حين سمى هذه السورة «سورة بني النضير» وفي جعل هذا الإِخراج وقتاً لأوّل الحشر إيذان بأن حشرهم يتعاقب حتى يكمل إخراج جميع اليهود وذلك ما أوصى به النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قُبيل وفاته إذ قال :« لا يبقى دينان في جزيرة العرب » وقد أنفذه عمر بن الخطاب حين أجلى اليهود من جميع بلاد العرب . وقيل : وُصف الحشر بالأول لأنه أول جلاء أصاب بني النضير ، فإن اليهود أُجْلُوا من فلسطين مرتين مرة في زمن ( بختنصر ) ومرة في زمن ( طيطس ) سلطان الروم وسَلِم بنو النضير ومن معهم من الجلاء لأنهم كانوا في بلاد العرب . فكان أول جلاء أصابهم جلاء بني النضير .{ يَخْرُجُواْ وظنوا أَنَّهُمْ مَّانِعَتُهُمْ حُصُونُهُم مِّنَ } .أي كان ظن المسلمين وظن أهل الكتاب متواردين على تعذر إخراج بني النضير من قريتهم بسبب حصانة حصونهم .وكان اليهود يتخذون حصوناً يأوون إليها عندما يغزوهم العدوّ مثل حصون خيبر .وكانت لبني النضير ستة حصون أسماؤها : الكُتيبة ( بضم الكاف وفتح المثناة الفوقية ) والوَطِيح ( بفتح الواو وكسر الطاء ) والسُّلاَلم ( بضم السين ) والنَّطَاةُ ( بفتح النون وفتح الطاء بعدها ألف وبهاء تأنيث آخرَه ) والوَخْدَة ( بفتح الواو وسكون الخاء المعجمة ودال مهملة ) وشَقّ ( بفتح الشين المعجمة وتشديد القاف ) .ونظم جملة { وظنوا أنهم مانعتهم حصونهم } على هذا النظم دون أن يقال : وظَنُّوا أن حصونهم مانعتُهم ليكون الابتداء بضميرهم لأنه سيعقبه إسناد { مانعتهم } إليه فيكون الابتداء بضميرهم مشيراً إلى اغترارهم بأنفسهم أنهم في عزة ومَنَعة ، وأن مَنَعة حصونهم هي من شؤون عزتهم .وفي تقديم { مانعتهم } وهو وصف على { حصونهم } وهو اسم والاسم بحسب الظاهر أولى بأن يجعل في مرتبة المبتدأ ويجعل الوصف خبراً عنه ، فعدل عن ذلك إشارة إلى أهمية منَعة الحصون عند ظنهم فهي بمحل التقديم في استحضار ظنهم ، ولا عبرة بجواز جعل حصونهم فاعلاً باسم الفاعل وهو { مانعتهم } بناء على أنه معتمد على مسند إليه لأن محامل الكلام البليغ تجري على وجوه التصرف في دقائق المعاني فيصير الجائز مرجوحاً . قال المرزوقي في شرح ( باب النسب ) قول الشاعر وهو منسوب إلى ذي الرمة في غير ديوان الحماسة :فإن لم يكن إلا مُعَرَّج ساعة ... قليلاً فإني نافع لي قليلهايجوز أن يكون ( قليلها ) مبتدأ و ( نافع ) خبر مقدم عليه أي لقصد الاهتمام . والجملة في موضع خبر ( إنّ ) والتقدير : إني قليلها نافع لي .{ الله فأتاهم الله مِنْ حَيْثُ لَمْ يَحْتَسِبُواْ وَقَذَفَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ الرعب يُخْرِبُونَ بُيُوتَهُمْ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَيْدِى المؤمنين فاعتبروا ياأولى } .تفريع على مجموع جملتي { ما ظننتم أن يخرجوا وظنوا أنهم مانعتهم حصونهم من الله } اللتين هما تعليل للقصر في قوله تعالى : { هو الذي أخرج الذين كفروا من أهل الكتاب } .وتركيب ( أتاهم الله من حيث لم يحتسبوا ) تمثيل ، مُثِّل شأنُ الله حين يسّر أسباب استسلامهم بعد أن صمموا على الدفاع وكانوا أهل عِدة وعُدة ولم يطل حصارهم بحال من أخذ حذره من عدوّه وأحكم حراسته من جهاته فأتاه عدوه من جهة لم يكن قد أقام حراسة فيها .وهذا يشبه التمثيل الذي في قوله تعالى : { والذين كفروا أعمالهم كسراب بقيعة يحسبه الظمآن ماء حتى إذا جاءه لم يجده شيئاً ووجد الله عنده } [ النور : 39 ] .والاحتساب : مبالغة في الحسبان ، أي الظنّ أي من مكان لم يظنوه لأنهم قصروا استعدادهم على التحصّن والمنَعة ولم يعلموا أن قوة الله فوق قوتهم .والقذف : الرمي باليد بقوة . واستعير للحصول العاجل ، أي حصل الرعب في قلوبهم دفعة دون سابق تأمل ولا حصول سبب للرعب ولذلك لم يؤت بفعل القذف في آية [ آل عمران : 151 ] { سنلقي في قلوب الذين كفروا الرعب }والمعنى : وجعل الله الرعب في قلوبهم فأسرعوا بالاستسلام . وقَذْفُ الرعب في قلوبهم هو من أحوال إتيان الله إياهم من حيث لم يحتسبوا فتخصيصه بالذكر للتعجيب من صنع الله ، وعطفُه على أتاهم الله من حيث لم يحتسبوا عطف خاص على عام للاهتمام .والرعب } : شدة الخوف والفزع . وهذا معنى قول النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم « نصرت بالرعب » ، أي برعب أعداء الدين .وجملة { يخربون بيوتهم } حال من الضمير المضاف إليه { قلوبهم } لأن المضاف جزء من المضاف إليه فلا يمنع مجيء الحال منه .والمقصود التعجيب من اختلال أمورهم فإنهم وإن خربوا بيوتهم باختيارهم لكن داعي التخريب قهري .والإِخراب والتخريب : إسقاط البناء ونقضه . والخراب : تهدم البناء .وقرأ الجمهور { يخربون } بسكون الخاء وتخفيف الراء المكسورة مضارع : أَخرب . وقرأه أبو عمرو وحْده بفتح الخاء وتشديد الراء المكسورة مضارع : خَرَّب . وهما بمعنى واحد . قال سيبويه : إن أفعلت وفَعَّلت يتعاقبان نحْو أخربته وخَرّبته ، وأفرحته وفرّحته . يريد في أصل المعنى . وقد تقدم ما ذكر من الفرق بين : أَنزل ونَزّل في المقدمة الأولى من مقدمات هذا التفسير .وأشارت الآية إلى ما كان من تخريب بني النضير بيوتهم ليأخذوا منها ما يصلح من أخشاب وأبواب مما يحملونه معهم ليبنوا به منازلهم في مهاجرهم ، وما كان من تخريب المؤمنين بقية تلك البيوت كلما حلّوا بقعة تركها بنو النضير .وقوله : { بأيديهم } هو تخريبهم البيوت بأيديهم ، حقيقةٌ في الفعل وفي ما تعلق به ، وأما تخريبهم بيوتهم بأيدي المؤمنين فهو مجاز عقلي في إسناد التخريب الذي خربه المؤمنون إلى بني النضير باعتبار أنهم سبَّبوا تخريب المؤمنين لما تركه بنو النضير .فعطف { أيدي المؤمنين } على { بأيديهم } بحيث يصير متعلّقاً بفعل { يخربون } استعمال دقيق لأن تخريب المؤمنين ديار بني النضير لمّا وجدوها خاوية تخريب حقيقي يتعلق المجرور به حقيقة .فالمعنى : ويسببون خراب بيوتهم بأيدي المؤمنين فوقع إسناد فعل { يخربون } على الحقيقة ووقع تعلق وتعليق { وأيدي المؤمنين } به على اعتبار المجاز العقلي ، فالمجاز في التعليق الثاني .وأما معنى التخريب فهو حقيقي بالنسبة لكلا المتعلقين فإن المعنى الحقيقي فيهما هو العبرة التي نبه عليها قوله تعالى : { فاعتبروا يا أولي الأبصار } ، أي اعتبروا بأن كان تخريب بيوتهم بفعلهم وكانت آلات التخريب من آلاتهم وآلات عدوهم .والاعتبار : النظر في دلالة الأشياء على لوازمها وعواقبها وأسبابها . وهو افتعال من العبرة ، وهي الموعظة . وقول «القاموس» : هي العجب قصور .وتقدم في قوله تعالى : { لقد كان في قصصهم عبرة لأولي الألباب } في سورة [ يوسف : 111 ] .والخطاب في قوله : يا أولي الأبصار } موجّه إلى غير معين . ونودي أولو الأبصار بهذه الصلة ليشير إلى أن العبرة بحال بني النضير واضحة مكشوفة لكل ذي بَصر مما شاهد ذلك ، ولكل ذي بصر يرى مواقع ديارهم بعدهم ، فتكون له عبرة قدرة الله على إخراجهم وتسليط المسلمين عليهم من غير قتال . وفي انتصار الحق على الباطل وانتصار أهل اليقين على المذبذبين .وقد احتج بهذه الآية بعض علماء الأصول لإِثبات حجّيّة القياس بناء على أنه من الاعتبار ."

The word linah refers to a 'palm-tree'. Another opinion states that besides ` ajwah, all other palm trees are referred to as linah. Banu Nadir's orchards were comprised of palm trees. The reference in the verse is to the cutting, by the orders of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، of the palm trees of Banu Nadir who had shut themselves in their fortresses in defiance of the Holy Prophet's ﷺ orders to surrender. So, some of the blessed Companions, in order to anger them or cast terror into their hearts, cut and burned down some of their date trees. Other Companions felt that the palm-trees should not be destroyed because soon, God willing, the Muslims will be victorious and the orchards will fall to their lot as booty. Thus they did not participate in the destruction of the trees. This was a difference of opinion. Later on when this disagreement was discussed, the Companions who participated in the destruction of the trees or orchards felt guilty. They asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ whether they were really guilty of a sin, in that they destroyed the property that was going to fall to the lot of the Muslims. Verse [ 5] was revealed on that occasion to assuage the guilt-feeling of the Muslims that whatever they have done, whether they cut the trees or left them uncut, was by Allah's leave and it was done to degrade the ungodly Jews.</p><p>Commandment of the Holy Prophet ﷺ is in fact the Commandment of Allah: A Warning for those who Refute the authority of the Ahadith</p><p>In verse [ 5], the cutting down of the trees or leaving them uncut is called bi-idhni-llah [ with Allah's permission ] whereas neither of the actions was the explicit command of Allah. Apparently, whatever each group did was on the basis of independent reasoning [ Ijtihad ]. At most, it is possible that they might have sought the permission of the Holy Prophet ﷺ which is a Hadith. The 'Prophet's ﷺ permission' is referred to as 'Allah's permission' in the Qur'an. Thus the Qur'an makes plain that Allah has given His Messenger ﷺ the right to legislate laws. The forthcoming verse [ 7] of this Surah puts it that believers need to hold fast to what the Messenger ﷺ bids them and abstain from what he forbids them. This shows conclusively that the Sunnah is an independent source of the Islamic Law.</p><p>Disagreement in ijtihad is not a sin</p><p>Another important principle derived from this verse is that if those who are competent to undertake ijtihad disagree with another on a particular issue, so as one of them holds something as permissible, while the other takes it as impermissible, neither of them would be counted as sinners, nor will the principle of nahy ` anil-munkar (forbidding evil) be applied to this situation, because none of the two rulings is an 'evil' in the sight of Allah. Under the concluding phrase of verse [ 5] لِيُخْزِيَ الْفَاسِقِينَ (...and that he might disgrace the transgressors) it was explained that the act of cutting or burning down the trees cannot be construed as disorderliness. But it was done to degrade the unbelievers, and therefore it carries reward in the Hereafter.</p><p>Ruling</p><p>Is it legitimate to demolish or burn down the homes of the infidels, or cut or burn down their trees, or destroy their fields and farms? The leading authorities on Islamic Jurisprudence are not unanimous on this question. Imam A'zam Abu Hanifah (رح) rules that all of these actions are permitted. Shaikh Ibn Humam (رح) ، however, qualifies the ruling and restricts it. He rules that all of the above are permitted if and only if the enemies cannot be vanquished or overpowered without resorting to the above measures, or if the victory of Muslims is not probable or likely. The whole purpose of this ruling is to break the might and power of the enemy. In the case where Muslims do not win the struggle, destruction of their moveable and immovable properties may be included in weakening their might and main. [ Mazhari ]</p>"

فقال قتادة والضحاك : إنهم قطعوا من نخيلهم وأحرقوا ست نخلات . وقال محمد بن إسحاق : إنهم قطعوا نخلة وأحرقوا نخلة . وكان ذلك عن إقرار رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أو بأمره ; إما لإضعافهم بها ، وإما لسعة المكان بقطعها . فشق ذلك عليهم فقالوا وهم يهود أهل الكتاب : يا محمد ، ألست تزعم أنك نبي تريد الصلاح ، أفمن الصلاح قطع النخل وحرق الشجر ؟ وهل وجدت فيما أنزل الله عليك إباحة الفساد في الأرض ؟ فشق ذلك على النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم . ووجد المؤمنون في أنفسهم حتى اختلفوا ; فقال بعضهم : لا تقطعوا مما أفاء الله علينا . وقال بعضهم : اقطعوا لنغيظهم بذلك . فنزلت الآية بتصديق من نهى عن القطع وتحليل من قطع من الإثم ، وأخبر أن قطعه وتركه بإذن الله . وقال شاعرهم سماك اليهودي في ذلك :[ ص: 9 ]ألسنا ورثنا الكتاب الحكيم على عهد موسى ولم نصدف     وأنتم رعاء لشاء عجافبسهل تهامة والأخيف     ترون الرعاية مجدا لكملدى كل دهر لكم مجحف     فيا أيها الشاهدون انتهواعن الظلم والمنطق المؤنف     لعل الليالي وصرف الدهوريدلن من العادل المنصف     بقتل النضير وإجلائهاوعقر النخيل ولم تقطففأجابه حسان بن ثابت :تفاقد معشر نصروا قريشا     وليس لهم ببلدتهم نصيرهموا أوتوا الكتاب فضيعوه     وهم عمي عن التوراة بوركفرتم بالقران وقد أبيتم     بتصديق الذي قال النذيروهان على سراة بني لؤي     حريق بالبويرة مستطيرفأجابه أبو سفيان بن الحارث بن عبد المطلب :أدام الله ذلك من صنيع     وحرق في نواحيها السعيرستعلم أينا منها بنزه     وتعلم أي أرضينا تصيرفلو كان النخيل بها ركابا     لقالوا لا مقام لكم فسيرواالثانية : كان خروج النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم إليهم في ربيع الأول أول السنة الرابعة من الهجرة ، وتحصنوا منه في الحصون ، وأمر بقطع النخل وإحراقها ، وحينئذ نزل تحريم الخمر . ودس عبد الله بن أبي ابن سلول ومن معه من المنافقين إلى بني النضير : إنا معكم ، وإن قوتلتم قاتلنا معكم ، وإن أخرجتم خرجنا معكم ; فاغتروا بذلك . فلما جاءت الحقيقة خذلوهم وأسلموهم وألقوا بأيديهم ، وسألوا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يكف عن دمائهم ويجليهم ; على أن لهم ما حملت الإبل من أموالهم إلا السلاح ، فاحتملوا كذلك إلى خيبر ، ومنهم من سار إلى الشام . وكان ممن سار منهم إلى خيبر أكابرهم ;

قاله في المدونة . الثاني : إن علم المسلمون أن ذلك لهم لم يفعلوا ، وإن يئسوا فعلوا ; قاله مالك في الواضحة . وعليه يناظر أصحاب الشافعي . ابن العربي : والصحيح الأول . وقد علم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أن نخل بني النضير له ; ولكنه قطع وحرق ليكون ذلك نكاية لهم ووهنا فيهم حتى يخرجوا عنها . وإتلاف بعض المال لصلاح باقيه مصلحة جائزة شرعا ، مقصودة عقلا .الرابعة : قال الماوردي : إن في هذه الآية دليلا على أن كل مجتهد مصيب . وقاله الكيا الطبري قال : وإن كان الاجتهاد يبعد في مثله مع وجود النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم بين أظهرهم ، ولا شك أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم رأى ذلك وسكت ;

أخذا بعموم الأذية للكفار ، ودخولا في الإذن للكل لما يقضي عليهم بالاجتياح والبوار ; وذلك قوله تعالى : وليخزي الفاسقين .الخامسة : اختلف في اللينة ما هي ; على أقوال عشرة : الأول : النخل كله إلا العجوة ;

حكاه الماوردي . وقيل : هي ضرب من النخل يقال لتمره : اللون ، تمره أجود التمر ، [ ص: 11 ] وهو شديد الصفرة ، يرى نواه من خارجه ويغيب فيه الضرس ; النخلة منها أحب إليهم من وصيف . وقيل : هي النخلة القريبة من الأرض .وأنشد الأخفش :قد شجاني الحمام حين تغنى     بفراق الأحباب من فوق لينهوقيل : إن اللينة الفسيلة ; لأنها ألين من النخلة . ومنه قول الشاعر :غرسوا لينها بمجرى معين     ثم حفوا النخيل بالآجاموقيل : إن اللينة الأشجار كلها للينها بالحياة ; قال ذو الرمة :طراق الخوافي واقع فوق لينة     ندى ليله في ريشه يترقرقوالقول العاشر : أنها الدقل ; قاله الأصمعي . قال : وأهل المدينة يقولون : لا تنتفخ الموائد حتى توجد الألوان ; يعنون الدقل . قال ابن العربي : والصحيح ما قاله الزهري ومالك لوجهين : أحدهما : أنهما أعرف ببلدهما وأشجارهما . الثاني : أن الاشتقاق يعضده ، وأهل اللغة يصححونه ; فإن اللينة وزنها لونة ، واعتلت على أصولهم فآلت إلى لينة فهي لون ، فإذا دخلت الهاء كسر أولها ; كبرك الصدر ( بفتح الباء ) وبركه ( بكسرها ) لأجل الهاء . وقيل لينة أصلها لونة فقلبت الواو ياء لانكسار ما قبلها . وجمع اللينة لين . وقيل : ليان ; قال امرؤ القيس يصف عنق فرسه :وسالفة كسحوق الليا     ن أضرم فيها الغوي السعروقال الأخفش : إنما سميت لينة اشتقاقا من اللون لا من اللين . المهدوي : واختلف في اشتقاقها ; فقيل : هي من اللون وأصلها لونة . وقيل : أصلها لينة من لان يلين . وقرأ عبد الله \" ما قطعتم من لينة ولا تركتم قوماء على أصولها \" أي قائمة على سوقها . وقرأ الأعمش \" ما قطعتم من لينة أو تركتموها قوما على أصولها \" المعنى لم تقطعوها . وقرئ \" قوماء على أصلها \" . وفيه وجهان : أحدهما : أنه جمع أصل ; كرهن ورهن . والثاني : اكتفي فيه بالضمة عن [ الواو ] . وقرئ : \" قائما على أصوله \" ذهابا إلى لفظ \" ما \" .فبإذن الله أي بأمره وليخزي الفاسقين أي ليذل اليهود الكفار به وبنبيه وكتبه ."

Они считали, что мусульмане бесчинствуют на их земле, и вменяли им это в преступление. Тогда Всевышний Аллах сказал, что мусульмане лишь выполняли повеление Господа для того, чтобы опозорить грешников. Господь побудил их срубать и сжигать пальмы, чтобы тем самым покарать, посрамить и унизить неверующих, дабы те узрели свое полное бессилие. Иудеи не смогли защитить свои деревья и спасти их, несмотря на то, что именно финиковые плантации некогда служили опорой их власти. Согласно наиболее достоверному толкованию, арабское слово лина (зд. ‘пальмы’) относится ко всем разновидностям пальмовых деревьев. Такой была участь племени Надыр, и таким было их наказание в мирской жизни. Затем Всевышний Аллах сообщил о тех, кому досталось имущество и владения иудеев, и сказал:"

For instance, the booty collected from Bani An-Nadir was not acquired because of fighting them using horses and camels. The Muslims did not fight Bani An-Nadir in battle, but Allah forced them out of their forts on account of the fear that He placed in their hearts for Allah's Messenger ﷺ. Therefore, it was Fai' that Allah awarded His Messenger, with his discretion to spend it however he sees fit. Indeed, the Prophet spent the Fai' on righteous causes and for the benefit of Muslims in the areas that Allah mentioned in this Ayat,</p><p>وَمَآ أَفَآءَ اللَّهُ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(And what Allah gave as booty (Fai') to His Messenger from them) meaning, from Bani An-Nadir,</p><p>فَمَآ أَوْجَفْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ خَيْلٍ وَلاَ رِكَابٍ</p><p>(for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry.) refering to using camels,</p><p>وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يُسَلِّطُ رُسُلَهُ عَلَى مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p>(But Allah gives power to His Messengers over whomsoever He wills. And Allah is Able to do all things.) mean, Allah is powerful and cannot be resisted or opposed; He is the Compeller over all things. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>مَّآ أَفَآءَ اللَّهُ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَى</p><p>(What Allah gave as booty (Fai') to His Messenger from the people of the townships) meaning, from all the villages and areas that are conquered in this manner; the booty collected from them falls under the same ruling as the booty acquired from Bani An-Nadir. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>فَلِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِى الْقُرْبَى وَالْيَتَامَى وَالْمَسَـكِينِ وَابْنِ السَّبِيلِ</p><p>(it is for Allah, His Messenger, the kindred, the orphans, the poor, and the wayfarer,) until its end and the following Ayah. mentioning the ways the Fai' should be spent. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Umar said, \"The wealth of Bani An-Nadir was of the Fai' type that Allah awarded His Messenger and for which the Muslims did not have to use cavalry or camelry. Therefore, it was for the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and he used it for the needs of his family for a year at a time, and the rest was used to buy armors and weapons used in the cause of Allah the Exalted and Most Honored.\" Ahmad collected the short form of this story. The Group, with the exception of Ibn Majah, collected this Hadith. Abu Dawud recorded that Malik bin `Aws said,\"While I was at home, the sun rose high and it got hot. Suddenly the messenger of `Umar bin Al-Khattab came to me and I went along with him and entered the place where `Umar was sitting on a bedstead made of date-palm leaves and without a mattress. He said when I went in, `O Malik! Some of your people's families came to me due to their famine, and I have ordered that relief aid should be given to them, so take it and distribute it among them.' I said, `I wish that you ordered someone else to do it.' He said, `Take it.' Then Yarfa (the servant of `Umar) came saying, `O Commander of the faithful! May I admit `Uthman bin `Affan, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf, Az-Zubayr bin Al-`Awwam and Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas' `Umar said, `Yes,' and they came in. After a while Yarfa came again and said, `O Commander of the faithful! May I admit Al-`Abbas and `Ali' `Umar said, `Yes.' So, they were admitted and Al-`Abbas said, `O Chief of the believers! Judge between me and this one (i.e., `Ali).' The group (being `Uthman and his companions) said, `O Chief of the believers! Judge between them and relieve both of them from each other.' I (Malik bin Aws) thought that they asked the four men to come in before them for this purpose. `Umar said, `Be patient!' He then asked the group (`Uthman and his companions), `I ask you by Allah by Whose permission the heaven and the earth exist, do you know that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا نُورَثُ، مَا تَرَكْنَا صَدَقَة»</p><p>(Our (the Prophet's) property will not be inherited. Whatever we leave, is charity)' The group said, `He said so.' `Umar then turned to `Ali and Al-`Abbas and said, `I beseech you by Allah by Whose permission the heaven and the earth exist, do you know both that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا نُورَثُ، مَا تَرَكْنَا صَدَقَة»</p><p>(Our (the Prophets`) property will not be inherited. Whatever we leave, is charity)' They replied, `He said so.' `Umar then said, `Allah bestowed on His Messenger a special favor unlike what he gave all other people. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَمَآ أَفَآءَ اللَّهُ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ مِنْهُمْ فَمَآ أَوْجَفْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ خَيْلٍ وَلاَ رِكَابٍ وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يُسَلِّطُ رُسُلَهُ عَلَى مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p>(And what Allah gave as booty (Fai') to His Messenger from them -- for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry. But Allah gives power to His Messengers over whomsoever He wills. And Allah is Able to do all things.) Therefore, this property, the booty collected from Bani An-Nadir, was especially given to Allah's Messenger ﷺ. However, by Allah, neither did he take possession of it and leave you, nor did he favor himself with it to your exclusion. Allah's Messenger ﷺ took the yearly expenses from it for himself and his family and left the rest in the Muslim Treasury.' He then asked the group, `I ask you by Allah with Whose permission the heavens and earth exist, do you know this' They replied, `Yes.' `Umar then said to `Ali and Al-`Abbas, `I ask you by Allah, with Whose permission that heavens and earth exist, do you know this' They said, `Yes.' `Umar added, `When Allah took His Prophet unto Him, Abu Bakr said: I am the successor of Allah's Messenger ﷺ! Then you both came to Abu Bakr asking for your (Al-`Abbas') share of inheritance from your nephew, and he (`Ali) asked for his wife's share from her father's inheritance. Abu Bakr said: Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا نُورَثُ، مَا تَرَكْنَا صَدَقَة»</p><p>(Our (the Prophets') property will not be inherited. Whatever we leave, is charity.)\" Allah knows that Abu Bakr was true, pious, rightly guided and a follower of what was right. So, Abu Bakr assumed the responsibility of that property. When Abu Bakr died, I said: I am the successor of Allah's Messenger ﷺ and the successor of Abu Bakr. So I managed it as long as Allah allowed me to manage it. Then you both (`Ali and Al-`Abbas) came to talk to me, bearing the same claim and presenting the same case, asking for that property. I said to you: I am ready to hand over this property to you if you wish. I will do so on the condition that you will take a pledge before Allah's that you will manage it in the same way as Allah's Messenger ﷺ used to. So, both of you agreed and on that condition I handed it over to you. Now you come to me to render a different judgement over the property than the one I made before. By Allah, I will never give any decision other than what I have already given, until the Last Hour begins. If you are unable to manage it, then return it to me, and I will do the job on your behalf.,\" They recorded this from the Hadith of Az-Zuhri. Allah said,</p><p>كَى لاَ يَكُونَ دُولَةً بَيْنَ الاٌّغْنِيَآءِ مِنكُمْ</p><p>(in order that it may not become a fortune used by the rich among you.) means, `We made the expenditures for the Fai' like this, so that the wealth does not remain among the wealthy, who would spend it as they wish and desire and give none of it to the poor.'</p><h2>Ordering Obedience of the Messenger in All Commands and Prohibitions</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَمَآ ءَاتَـكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَـكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُواْ</p><p>(And whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it).) meaning, `whatever the Messenger commands you, then do it and whatever he forbids you, then avoid it. Surely, He only commands righteousness and forbids evil.' Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"Allah curses women who practice tattooing and those who get themselves tattooed, and the women who remove the hair from their eyebrows and faces and those who make artificial spaces between their teeth in order to look more beautiful, whereby changing Allah's creation.\" His statement reached a woman from Bani Asad called, Umm Ya`qub, who came to `Abdullah and said, \"I have come to know that you have cursed such and such\" He replied, \"Why should I not curse those whom Allah's Messenger ﷺ has cursed and who are cursed in Allah's Book!\" Umm Ya`qub said, \"I have read the whole Qur'an, but did not find in it what you say.\" He said, \"Verily, if you have read the Qur'an, you have found it. Didn't you read,</p><p>وَمَآ ءَاتَـكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَـكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُواْ</p><p>(And whatsoever the Messenger gives you take it and whatsoever he forbids you, you abstain (from it).)\" She replied, \"Yes, I did.\" He said, \"Verily, Allah's Messenger ﷺ forbade such things. \" \"She said, \"But I think that your wife does these things\" He said, \"Go and look at her.\" She went and watched her, but could not see anything in support of her claim. She went back to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud and said that she did not notice anything on his wife. On that he said, \"If my wife was as you thought, I would not keep her with me.\" The Two Sahihs recorded this from the Hadith of Sufyan Ath-Thawri. As well as a Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا أَمَرْتُكُمْ بِأَمْرٍ فَائْتُوا مِنْهُ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُمْ، وَمَا نَهَيْتُكُمْ عَنْهُ فَاجْتَنِبُوه»</p><p>(When I order you to do something, then do as much as you can of it. If I forbid something for you, then shun it.) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ آلْعِقَابِ</p><p>(Have Taqwa of Allah; verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.) means, fear Allah by obeying His orders and refraining from His prohibitions. Surely, Allah is severe in punishment for those who defy Him and reject and disobey His commands as well as, those who commit what He forbids and prohibits.</p>"

(আরবী)-এ আয়াতটি পাঠ করে বলেনঃ “আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা বানী নাযীরের মাল স্বীয় রাসূল (সঃ)-কে ফায় স্বরূপ দিয়েছিলেন। আল্লাহর কসম! না আমি এতে আপনাদের উপর অন্য কাউকেও প্রাধান্য দিয়েছি, না আমি নিজে সবই নিয়ে নিয়েছি। রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) এটা হতে তাঁর নিজের ও পরিবারবর্গের এক বছরের খরচ গ্রহণ করতেন এবং বাকীটা বায়তুল মালে জমা দিতেন। তারপর তিনি ঐ চারজন মহান ব্যক্তিকে অনুরূপভাবে আল্লাহর কসম দিয়ে জিজ্ঞেস করেনঃ “এটা কি আপনাদের জানা আছে?” তাঁরা ‘হ্যাঁ' বলে উত্তরে দেন। তারপর তিনি ঐ দুই সম্মানিত ব্যক্তিকে ঐ রূপ কসম দিয়ে জিজ্ঞেস করেন এবং তারাও উত্তরে ‘হ্যাঁ’ বলেন। অতঃপর হযরত উমার (রাঃ) বলেনঃ “রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-এর ইন্তেকালের পর হযরত আবু বকর (রাঃ) খলীফা নির্বাচিত হন। তারপর আপনারা দুজন (হযরত আলী রাঃ ও হযরত আব্বাস রাঃ) তাঁর কাছে আসেন। হে আব্বাস (রাঃ)! আপনি আত্মীয়তার দাবী জানিয়ে আপনার ভ্রাতুস্পুত্র (সঃ)-এর মাল হতে আপনার মীরাস যাজ্ঞা করেন। আর ইনি অর্থাৎ হযরত আলী (রাঃ) নিজের প্রাপ্যের দাবী জানিয়ে স্বীয় স্ত্রী অর্থাৎ হযরত ফাতিমা (রাঃ)-এর পক্ষ হতে তাঁর পিতা (সঃ)-এর মালের মীরাস চেয়ে বসেন। জবাবে হযরত আবু বকর (রাঃ) আপনাদের দুজনকে বলেনঃ “রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “আমরা কোন ওয়ারিশ রেখে যাই না। আমরা যা কিছু ছেড়ে যাই তা সাদকারূপে গণ্য হয়।” আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা খুব ভাল জানেন যে, হযরত আবু বকর (রাঃ) নিশ্চিতরূপে একজন সত্যবাদী, পুণ্যবান, হিদায়াতপ্রাপ্ত ও সত্যের অনুসারী ব্যক্তি ছিলেন। তিনি যতদিন খলীফা ছিলেন ততদিন তিনি এ মালের জিম্মাদার ছিলেন। তাঁর ইন্তেকালের পর আমি রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-এর খলীফা নির্বাচিত হয়েছি। তারপর ঐ মাল আমার জিম্মাদারীতে চলে আসে। এরপর এক পর্যায়ে আপনারা দু'জন আমার নিকট আগমন করেন এবং নিজেরা এই মালের জিম্মাদার হওয়ার প্রস্তাব ও দাবী জানান। জবাবে আমি আপনাদেরকে বলি যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) যেভাবে এ মাল খরচ করতেন আপনারাও ঐ ভাবে খরচ করবেন এই শর্তে যদি আপনারা এই মালের জিম্মাদার হতে চান তবে আমি এটা আপনাদের হাতে সমর্পণ করতে পারি। আপনারা এটা স্বীকার করে নেন এবং আল্লাহ্ তা'আলাকে সাক্ষী রেখে আপনারা এ মালের জিম্মাদারী গ্রহণ করেন। অতঃপর এখন আপনারা আমার কাছে এসেছেন, তবে কি আপনারা এছাড়া অন্য কোন ফায়সালা চান? আল্লাহর কসম! কিয়ামত পর্যন্ত আমি এছাড়া অন্য কোন ফায়সালা করতে পারি না। হ্যাঁ, এটা হতে পারে যে, যদি আপনারা আপনাদের অঙ্গীকার অনুযায়ী এই মালের রক্ষণাবেক্ষণ ও খরচ করতে অপারগ হন তবে এর জিম্মাদারী আমাকে ফিরিয়ে দেন যাতে আমি নিজেই এটাকে ঐ রূপেই খরচ করি যেরূপে রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) খরচ করতেন এবং যেভাবে হযরত আবু বকর (রাঃ)-এর খিলাফতের যুগে খরচ করা হতো এবং আজ পর্যন্ত হচ্ছে।” (ইমাম আবু দাউদ (রঃ) এটা বর্ণনা করেছেন)হযরত আনাস ইবনে মালিক (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত, তিনি বলেনঃ “জনগণ রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ)-কে তাদের গাছ ইত্যাদি প্রদান করতো। অবশেষে যখন বানী কুরাইযা ও বানী নাযীরের ধন-সম্পদ তার অধিকারভুক্ত হলো তখন রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) তাঁকে প্রদত্ত জনগণের মালগুলো তিনি জনগণকে ফিরিয়ে দিতে শুরু করলেন। তখন আমার পরিবারস্থ লোকগুলো আমাকে রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ)-এর নিকট এ কথা বলার জন্যে পাঠালো যে, তিনি যেন আমাদেরকেও আমাদের তাঁকে প্রদত্ত সম্পদগুলো ফিরিয়ে দেন। আমি রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-কে একথা বললে তিনি ওগুলো আমাদেরকে ফিরিয়ে দেয়ার নির্দেশ দেন। কিন্তু তিনি ওগুলো তার পক্ষ হতে হযরত উম্মে আইমান (রাঃ)-কে দিয়ে রেখেছিলেন। হযরত উম্মে আইমান (রাঃ) যখন জানতে পারলেন যে, এগুলো তাঁর নিকট হতে নিয়ে নেয়া হবে তখন তিনি আমার ঘাড়ের উপর কাপড় রেখে দিয়ে বললেনঃ “যে আল্লাহ্ ছাড়া কোন মা'বূদ নেই তাঁর কসম! এগুলো আমি আপনাকে কখনই দিবো না। এগুলো তো রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) আমাকে দিয়ে রেখেছেন!” রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) তখন তাঁকে বললেনঃ “হে উম্মে আইমান (রাঃ)! এর বিনিময়ে আমি তোমাকে এতো এতো প্রদান করবে (সুতরাং তোমার চিন্তার কোন কারণ নেই)।” কিন্তু তিনি মানলেন না, বরং ঐ কথাই বলতে থাকলেন। আবার রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) তাঁকে বললেনঃ “তোমার জন্যে এতো এতো রয়েছে। এতেও তিনি সন্তুষ্ট হলেন না, বরং একই কথা বলতে থাকলেন। রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) পুনরায় বললেনঃ “তোমাকে এই পরিমাণ, এই পরিমাণ দেয়া হবে। আমার ধারণা হয় যে, তিনি শেষ পর্যন্ত বললেনঃ “তোমাকে যা দেয়া হয়েছে তার প্রায় দশগুণ দেয়া হবে, তখন তিনি খুশী হলেন এবং নীরবতা অবলম্বন করলেন। সুতরাং আমাদের মাল আমাদেরকে ফিরিয়ে দেয়া হলো।” (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম আহমাদ (রঃ), ইমাম বুখারী (রঃ) এবং ইমাম মুসলিম (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন) ফায়-এর এই মাল যে পাঁচ জায়গায় খরচ করা হবে, গানীমতের মাল খরচ করার জায়গাও এই পাঁচটি। সূরায়ে আনফালে এর পূর্ণ তাত্রী ও তাওযীহ্ সহ পরিপূর্ণ তাফসীর আল্লাহ্ পাকের ফযল ও করমে গত হয়েছে। এ জন্যে এখানে আমরা আর এর পুনরাবৃত্তি করলাম না।এরপর মহান আল্লাহ বলেনঃ ফায়-এর মালের খরচের জায়গাগুলো আমি এজন্যেই স্পষ্টভাবে বর্ণনা করলাম যাতে তোমাদের মধ্যে যারা বিত্তবান শুধু তাদের মধ্যেই ঐশ্বর্য আবর্তন না করে। শুধু মালদারদের হাতে চলে গেলে তারা তাদের ইচ্ছামত তা খরচ করতো এবং দরিদ্রদের হাতে তা আসতো না।ইরশাদ হচ্ছেঃ আমার রাসূল (সঃ) তোমাদেরকে যে কাজ করতে বলে তা তোমরা কর এবং যা হতে তোমাদেরকে নিষেধ করে তা হতে বিরত থাকো। তোমরা এ বিশ্বাস রাখো যে, রাসূল (সঃ) তোমাদেরকে যে কাজ করার আদেশ করে সেটা ভাল কাজই হয় এবং যে কাজ হতে তোমাদেরকে নিষেধ করে তা নিঃসন্দেহে মন্দ কাজ।হযরত মাসরূক (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, একজন মহিলা হযরত ইবনে মাসউদ (রাঃ)-এর নিকট এসে বলেঃ “আমার নিকট এ খবর পৌছেছে যে, আপনি নারীদের উল্কি করা হতে ও চুলে চুল মিলিত করা হতে নিষেধ করে থাকেন, আচ্ছা বলুন তো, আপনি এটা আল্লাহর কিতাবে পেয়েছেন, অথবা রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) হতে শুনেছেন?” উত্তরে হযরত ইবনে মাসউদ (রাঃ) বলেনঃ “হ্যাঁ, এটা আমি আল্লাহর কিতাবেও পেয়েছি এবং রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) হতেও  শুনেছি।” একথা শুনে মহিলাটি বলেঃ “আমি গোটা কুরআন মাজীদ পাঠ করেছি, কিন্তু কোথাও তো এটা পাইনি!” তখন হযরত ইবনে মাসউদ (রাঃ) বলেনঃ “তুমি তাতে (আরবী) (রাসূল সঃ তোমাদেরকে যা দেয় তা তোমরা গ্রহণ কর এবং যা হতে তোমাদেরকে নিষেধ করে তা হতে বিরত থাকো) এটা কি পাওনি?” মহিলাটি জবাবে বলেঃ “হ্যাঁ, তাতো পেয়েছি।” তখন হযরত ইবনে মাসউদ (রাঃ) বললেনঃ “আমি শুনেছি যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) উল্কি করা হতে, চুলে চুল মিলানো হতে এবং কপাল ও মুখমণ্ডলের চুল নূচা হতে নিষেধ করেছেন।” মহিলাটি তখন বললোঃ “জনাব! আপনার পরিবারের কোন কোন মহিলাও তো এরূপ করে থাকে?” তিনি তাকে বললেনঃ “তাহলে তুমি আমার বাড়ীর ভিতরে প্রবেশ করে দেখে এসো।” সে। গেল এবং দেখে এসে বললোঃ “জনাব! আমাকে ক্ষমা করুন! আমি ভুল বলেছি। উপরোক্তে কোন দোষ আপনার পরিবারের কোন মহিলার মধ্যে আমি দেখতে পেলাম না।” তখন হযরত ইবনে মাসউদ (রাঃ) মহিলাটিকে বললেনঃ “তুমি কি ভুলে গিয়েছে যে, আল্লাহর সৎ বান্দা (হযরত আয়েব আঃ) বলেছিলেনঃ (আরবী) অর্থাৎ “আমি এটা চাই না যে, যা হতে আমি তোমাদেরকে বিরত রাখছি আমি নিজে তার বিপরীত করবে।” (১১:৮৮) (এটা ইমাম ইবনে আবি হাতিম (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)হযরত আলকামা (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, হযরত আবদুল্লাহ ইবনে মাসউদ (রাঃ) বলেনঃ “আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা অভিসম্পাত বর্ষণ করেন ঐ নারীদের উপর যারা উল্কি করায় ও যারা উল্কি করে, যারা তাদের কপালের চুল নূচে এবং যারা নিজেদের সৌন্দর্য বৃদ্ধির জন্যে তাদের সামনের দাঁতগুলোর প্রশস্ততা সৃষ্টি করে এবং আল্লাহর তৈরীকৃত সৃষ্টির পরিবর্তন ঘটায়।” তার এ কথা শুনে বানী আসাদ গোত্রের উম্মে ইয়াকুব নাম্নী একটি মহিলা তাঁকে জিজ্ঞেস করেঃ “আপনি কি এরূপ কথা বলেছেন?” উত্তরে তিনি বলেনঃ “আল্লাহর রাসূল (সঃ) যার উপর লা'নত করেছেন, আমি কেন তার উপর লা'নত করবে না? আর যা কুরআন কারীমে বিদ্যমান রয়েছে?” মহিলাটি বললোঃ “আমি কুরআন কারীমের প্রথম হতে শেষ পর্যন্ত সবই পাঠ করেছি, কিন্তু আমি কোথাও তো এ হুকুম পাইনি?” তিনি বললেনঃ “তুমি যদি বুঝে ও চিন্তা করে পাঠ করতে তবে অবশ্যই তা পেতে। আল্লাহ্ তা'আলার উক্তিটি কি তুমি কুরআন কারীমে পাওনি?” সে জবাবে বললোঃ “হ্যাঁ, এটা তো পেয়েছি!” তারপর তিনি তাকে ঐ হাদীসটি শুনিয়ে দেন। তখন সে তাঁকে বললোঃ “আমার ধারণা যে, আপনার পরিবারের লোকও এই রূপ করে থাকে।” তিনি তাকে বললেনঃ “তুমি (আমার বাড়ীতে) যাও এবং দেখে এসো!” সে গেল, কিন্তু সে যা ধারণা করেছিল তার কিছুই দেখলো না। সুতরাং সে ফিরে এসে বললোঃ “আমি কিছুই দেখতে পেলাম না।” তিনি তখন বললেনঃ “যদি আমার গৃহিণী এরূপ করতো তবে অবশ্যই আমি তাকে ছেড়ে দিতাম।” (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম আহমাদ (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন এবং ইমাম বুখারী (রঃ) ও ইমাম মুসলিম(রঃ) তাঁদের সহীহ গ্রন্থদ্বয়ে এটা তাখরীজ করেছেন)হযরত আবু হুরাইরা (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “আমি যখন তোমাদেরকে কোন নির্দেশ দিই তখন তোমরা তোমাদের সাধ্যমত তা পালন করবে এবং যখন তোমাদেরকে কোন কিছু হতে নিষেধ করি তখন তোমরা তা হতে বিরত থাকবে।” (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম বুখারী (রঃ) ও ইমাম মুসলিম (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)হযরত উমার (রাঃ) ও হযরত ইবনে আব্বাস (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) কদুর খোলের তৈরী পাত্রে, সবুজ রং এর কলসে, আলকাতরার রঙ এ রঞ্জিত পাত্রে এবং কাঠে খোদাইকৃত পাত্রে নবীয তৈরী করতে অর্থাৎ খেজুর, কিসমিস্ ইত্যাদি ভিজিয়ে রাখতে নিষেধ করেছেন। অতঃর তাঁরা (আরবী) এই আয়াতটিই পাঠ করেন। (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম নাসাঈ (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)এরপর আল্লাহ্ তাবারাকা ওয়া তা'আলা বলেনঃ শাস্তি হতে রক্ষা পাওয়ার জন্যে তোমরা আল্লাহকে ভয় করতঃ তার নির্দেশাবলী মেনে চল এবং তাঁর নিষিদ্ধ বস্তুসমূহ হতে দূরে থাকো। জেনে রেখো যে, যারা তাঁর নাফরমানী ও বিরুদ্ধাচরণ করে এবং তিনি যা করতে নিষেধ করেছেন তা করে তাদেরকে তিনি কঠোর শাস্তি দেন এবং দুঃখের মার মারেন।</p>"

Whatever wealth of the Fay’ the Messenger gives you, take it, and whatever he does not allow you to take, then refrain from it. And be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed. Indeed, Allah is severe in punishment, so fear His punishment."

أيها المؤمنون - حكم أموال بنى النضير ، وهى أنها لرسولنا - صلى الله عليه وسلم - يضعها حيث شاء .أما ما أفاءه الله - تعالى - على رسوله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - من أموال أهل القرى الأخرى ، كقريظة وفدك وغيرهما فحكم هذا الفىء أنه يقسم إلى خمسة أقسام :قسم للرسول - صلى الله عليه وسلم - ينفق منه على نفسه وأهله وما تبقى منه يكون فى مصالح المسلمين .وقسم لأقاربه - صلى الله عليه وسلم - وهم : بنو هاشم وبنو المطلب .وقسم لليتامى : وهم أطفال المسلمين الذين مات آباؤهم عنهم قبل أن يبلغوا .وقسم للمساكين : وهم الذين ليس لهم مال يكفيهم ضررويات الحياة .وقسم لأبناء السبيل : وهم المسافرون المنقطعون عن مالهم فى سفرهم ، ولو كانوا أغنياء فى بلدهم .وقد رجح الإمام ابن جرير هذا الرأى ، فقال بعد استعراضه للأقوال : والصواب من القول فى ذلك عندى أن هذه الآية حكمها غير حكم الآية التى قبلها وذلك أن الآية التى قبلها ، مال جعله الله - عز وجل - لرسوله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - خاصة دون غيره . لم يجعل فيه لأحد نصيبا .فإذا كانت هذه الآية التى قبلها مضت ، وذكر المال الذى خص الله به رسوله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - ولم يجعل لأحد منه شيئا ، وكانت هذه الآية خبرا عن المال الذى جعله الله لأصناف شتى ، كان معلوما بذلك أن المال الذى جعله لأصناف من خلقه .غير المال الذى جعله للنبى - صلى الله عليه وسلم - .وقال الآلوسى عند تفسيره لهذه الآية ما مخلصه : قوله - تعالى - : ( مَّآ أَفَآءَ الله على رَسُولِهِ مِنْ أَهْلِ القرى . . ) بيان لحكم ما أفاءه الله على رسوله من قرى الكفار على العموم ، بعد بيان حكم ما أفاءه من بنى النضير .فالجملة جواب سؤال مقدر ناشىء مما فهم من الكلام السابق ، فكأن قائلا يقول : قد علمنا حكم ما أفاءه الله - تعالى - من بنى النضير ، فما حكم ما أفاء الله - عز وجل - من غيرهم؟فقيل : ما أفاء الله على رسوله من أهل القرى فلله وللرسول ولذى القربى . . . ولذا لم يعطف على ما تقدم ، ولم يذكر فى الآية قيد الإيجاف ولا عدمه . . .وسهمه - سبحانه - وسهم رسوله واحد ، وذكره - تعالى - : افتتاح كلام للتيمن والتبرك . فإن لله ما فى السموات وما فى الأرض ، وفيه تعظيم لشأن الرسول - صلى الله عليه وسلم - .وأهل القرى المذكورون فى الآية هم : أهل الصفراء ، وينبع ، ووادى القرى ، وما هنالك من قرى العرب ، التى تسمى قرى عرينة ، وحكمها مخالف لحكم أموال بنى النضير .ومن العلماء من يرى أن الآية التى معنا ، بمنزلة البيان والتفسير للآية التى قبلها ، لأن الآية الأولى لم تبين المستحقين للفىء الذى أفاءه الله - تعالى - على رسوله من أموال بنى النضير ، فجاءت الآية الثانية وبينت المستحقين له .وعلى رأس المفسرين الذين قالوا بهذا الرأى صاحب الكشاف ، فقد قال عند تفسيره لهذه الآية : لم يدخل - سبحانه - العاطف على هذه الجملة - وهى قوله : ( مَّآ أَفَآءَ . . . ) - لأنها بيان للأولى ، فهى منها غير أجنبية عنها . بين لرسوله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - ما يصنع بما أفاءه الله عليه ، وأمره أن يضعه حيث يضع الخمس من الغنائم ، مقسوما على الأقسام الخمسة .وقال الإمام ابن كثير : قوله - تعالى - : ( مَّآ أَفَآءَ الله على رَسُولِهِ مِنْ أَهْلِ القرى ) : أى جميع البلدان التى تفتح هكذا ، فحكمها حكم أموال بنى النضير ، ولهذا قال : ( فَلِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِي القربى واليتامى والمساكين وابن السبيل ) . فهذه مصارف أموال الفىء ووجوهه .ومن هذا نرى أن أصحاب الرأى الأول ، يقولون : إن الآيتين فى حكمين مختلفين ، لأن الآية الأولى فى بيان حكم أموال بنى النضير ، وأن الله - تعالى - قد جعلها للرسول - صلى الله عليه وسلم - يضعها حيث يشاء ، وأما الآية الثانية فهى فى حكم أموال القرى الأخرى التى أفاءها الله - تعالى - على رسوله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - ، وأن الله - تعالى - قد حدد له وجوه صرفها ، فقال : ( فَلِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِي القربى .. . ) .وأما أصحاب الرأى الثانى فيرون أن الآية الثانية مفصلة لما أجملته الآية الأولى ، وأن كل فىء يقسم بالطريقة التى بينتها الآية الثانية .ويبدو لنا أن الرأى الأول أقرب إلى الصواب ، لأن الثابت فى السنة الصحيحة : أن أموال بنى النضير ، لم يخمسها - صلى الله عليه وسلم - بل كانت له خاصة ، يوزعها كما يشاء ، وقد آثر بها المهاجرين ، وقسمها عليهم : ولم يعط الأنصار منها شيئا سوى ثلاثة رجال منهم ، كانت بهم حاجة فأعطاهم ، وبذلك نرى أنه - صلى الله عليه وسلم - لم يتقيد فى التوزيع لهذه الأموال ، بمن ورد ذكرهم فى الآية الثانية .وما دام الأمر كذلك ، فلا حاجة إلى القول بأن الآية الثانية ، ببيان وتفصيل للآية الأولى .هذا وهناك أقوال أخرى فى معنى هذه الآية ، مبسوطة فى كتب الفقه والتفسير ، فليرجع إليها من شاء المزيد من الأحكام الفقهية .وقوله - سبحانه - : ( كَيْ لاَ يَكُونَ دُولَةً بَيْنَ الأغنيآء مِنكُمْ . . ) بيان لحكمة هذا التشريع الذى شرعه - سبحانه - بالنسبة للأموال التى أتت عن طريق الفىء . . . والضمير المستتر فى قوله : ( يَكُونَ ) للفىء .و \" الدُّولة \" بضم الدال المشددة اسم لما يتداوله الناس فيما بينهم من أموال ، فيكون فى يد هذا تارة ، وفى يد ذاك تارة أخرى .والدَّولة - بفتح الدال المشددة - اسم للنوبة من الظفر والنصر فى الحرب وغيرها .يقال : لفلان على فلان دولة ، أى : غلبة ونصر .وبعضهم يرى أن الدولة - بالضم والفتح - بمعنى واحد ، وهو ما يدور ويدول للإنسان من الغنى والنصر .والمعنى : شرعنا لكم هذه الأحكام المتعلقة بتقسيم الفىء ، كى لا يكون المال الناجم عنه ، متداولا بين أيدى أغنيائكم دون فقرائكم .والمقصود بهذه الجملة الكريمة ، إبطال ما كان شائعا فى الجاهلية ، من استئثار قواد الجيوش ، ورؤساء القبائل ، بالكثير من الغنائم دون غيرهم ممن اشترك معهم فى الحروب ، كما قال أحد الشعراء ، لأحد الرؤساء أو القادة :لك المِربَاع منها والصفايا ... وحُكْمُك والنَّشيِطةُ والفُضُولأى : لك - أيها القائد وحدك - من الغنيمة ربعها ، والصفايا أى : والنفيس منها ، ولك - أيضا ما تحكم به على العدو ، ولك النشيطة ، وهى ما يصيبه الجيش من العدو قبل الحرب ، ولك - كذلك - الفضول ، أى : ما يبقى بعد قسمة الغنائم .وقد أبطل الإسلام كل ذلك ، حيث جعل مصارف الفىء ، تعود إلى المسلمين جميعا ، بطريقة عادلة ، بينها - سبحانه - فى هذه الآية وفى غيرها . .قال بعض العلماء : والجدير بالذكر هنا : أن دعاة المذاهب الاقتصادية الفاسدة ، يحتجون بهذه الآية على مذهبهم الفاسد ، ويقولون : ويجوز للدولة أن تستولى على مصادر الإنتاج ورءوس الأموال ، لتعطيها أو تشرك فيها الفقراء ، وما يسمونهم طبقة العمال ، وهذا على ما فيه من كساد اقتصادى ، وفساد اجتماعى ، قد ثبت خطؤه وظهر بطلانه مجانبا لحقيقة الاستدلال .قال بعض العلماء : والجدير بالذكر هنا : أن دعاة المذاهب الاقتصادية الفاسدة ، يحتجون بهذه الآية على مذهبهم الفاسد ، ويقولون : ويجوز للدولة أن تستولى على مصادر الإنتاج ورءوس الأموال ، لتعطيها أو تشرك فيها الفقراء ، وما يسمونهم طبقة العمال ، وهذا على ما فيه من كساد اقتصادى ، وفساد اجتماعى ، قد ثبت وظهر بطلانه مجانبا لحقيقة الاستدلال .لأن هذا المال ترك لمرافق المسلمين العامة ، من الإنفاق على المجاهدين ، وتأمين الغزاة فى الحدود والثغور ، وليس يعطى للأفراد كما يقولون ، ثم - هو أساسا - مال جاء غنيمة للمسملين ، وليس نتيجة كدح الفرد وكسبه الحلال .ولما كان مال الغنيمة ليس ملكا لشخص ، ولا هو - أيضا - كسب لشخص معين ، تحقق فيه العموم فى مصدره ، وهو الغنيمة ، والعموم فى مصرفه وعو عموم مصالح الأمة ، ولا دخل ولا وجود للفرد فيه ، فشتان بين هذا الأصل فى التشريع ، وهذا الفرع فى التضليل .ثم أمر - سبحانه - المسلمين أن يمتثلوا أمر رسولهم - صلى الله عليه وسلم - امتثالا تاما ، فقال : ( وَمَآ آتَاكُمُ الرسول فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فانتهوا واتقوا الله إِنَّ الله شَدِيدُ العقاب ) .وقوله : ( آتَاكُمُ ) من الإتيان ، والمقصود به هنا ما جاءهم به الرسول - صلى الله عليه وسلم - من هدايات وتشريعات ، وآداب . ويدخل فى ذلك دخولا أوليا قسمته لفىء بنى النضير بين المهاجرين ، دون الأنصار .أى : ما أمركم الرسول - صلى الله عليه وسلم - بفعله - أيها المؤمنون - فافعلوه ، وما نهاكم عن فعله فاجتنبوه ، واتقوا الله فى كل أحوالكم ، فإنه - سبحانه - شديد العقاب لمن خالف أمره . ومنهم من جعل ( آتَاكُمُ ) هنا بمعنى أعطاكم من الفىء ، وجعل ( نَهَاكُمْ ) بمعنى نهاكم عن الأخذ منه ، وكأن صاحب هذا الرأى يستعين على ما ذهب إليه بفحوى المقام .قال صاحب الكشاف : قوله : ( وَمَآ آتَاكُمُ الرسول ) من قسمة غنيمة أو فىء فخذوه وما نهاكم عنه ، أى : عن أخذه منه ( فانتهوا ) عنه .والأجود أن يكون - الأمر والنهى - عاما فى كل ما آتى رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - ونهى عنه ، أمر الفىء داخل فى عمومه .وقال الإمام ابن كثير : وقوله - تعالى - : ( وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فانتهوا ) ؟ قالت : بلى .قال : فإن رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - نهى عنه . قالت : إنى لأظن أهلك يفعلونه!!قال : اذهبى فانظرى ، فذهبت فلم تر من حاجتها شيئا . فجاءت فقالت : ما رأيت شيئا . قال : لو كان كذا لم تجامعنا .وقال بعض العلماء وفى الآية دليل على وجوب الآخذ بالسنن الصحيحة فى كل الأمور .وعن أبى رافع أن رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - قال : \" لا ألفين أحدكم متكئا على أريكته يأتيه أمر مما أمرت به أو نهيت عنه فيقول لا أدرى!! ما وجدنا فى كتاب الله اتبعناه . . \" .وهذا الحديث من أعلام النبوة ، فقد وقع ذلك بعدُ من الجاهلين بكتاب الله ، وبمنصب الرسالة ، ومن الزنادقة الصادين عن سبيل الله . ."

            "text": "Закон о трофеях распространяется на все подобные случаи, потому что Аллах сказал: «Добыча, которую Аллах вернул Своему посланнику от обитателей селений». Здесь имеются в виду любые селения, независимо от того, были они завоеваны во времена Пророка Мухаммада, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, или после его смерти, во времена правления мусульманских эмиров. Фей распределяется между Аллахом и Его посланником, родственниками Посланника, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, сиротами, бедняками и путниками. Это откровение похоже на следующий аят из суры «Аль-Анфаль»: «Знайте, что если вы захватили трофеи, то пятая часть их принадлежит Аллаху, Посланнику, близким родственникам Посланника, сиротам, беднякам и путникам» (8:41). Таким образом, фей делится на пять частей. Одна пятая принадлежит Аллаху и Его посланнику, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, и расходуется на нужды мусульман в целом. Одна пятая достается родственникам Пророка, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, и поровну распределяется между мужчинами и женщинами из рода Хашима и рода аль-Мутталиба, где бы они ни жили. Добыча распределяется только между потомками Хашима и аль-Мутталиба, а остальные представители рода Абд Манафа не имеют на нее прав, потому что только род аль-Мутталиба присоединился к роду Хашима в ущелье и помогал Пророку Мухаммаду, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, когда курейшиты договорились бойкотировать его родственников и начали враждовать с ними. Поэтому посланник Аллаха, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, сказал о роде аль-Мутталиба: «Они не покидали меня ни во времена невежества, ни в эпоху ислама». Одна пятая часть фея раздается неимущим сиротам, которыми считаются несовершеннолетние дети, потерявшие своих отцов. По одной пятой части также получают бедняки и путники, которые не имеют средств к существованию на чужбине. Всевышний распределил добычу так, дабы она не досталась богатым и зажиточным людям. Если бы не было этого мудрого законоположения, то богачи распределили бы трофеи между собой, а беспомощным беднякам не досталось бы ни гроша. Подобная несправедливость принесла бы много зла, обо всех тяжких последствиях которого известно одному лишь Аллаху. Если же люди повинуются воле Аллаха и придерживаются законов шариата, то они обретают неисчислимые блага. Поэтому Аллах ниспослал правоверным всеобщее правило и сказал: «Берите то, что дал вам Посланник, и сторонитесь того, что он вам запретил». Это распространяется как на мусульманские убеждения, так и на законы шариата. Каждый раб Аллаха обязан целиком и полностью повиноваться велениям Пророка Мухаммада, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, и руководствоваться его наставлениями, а любое нежелание соглашаться с ними противозаконно. Решение Пророка, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, по какому-либо вопросу равносильно решению Самого Аллаха, и никто ни при каких обстоятельствах не имеет права противиться воле Посланника, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, или ставить чье-либо мнение превыше его слов. Затем Господь велел правоверным страшиться Его, потому что благодаря этому раб Божий укрепляет свою душу и сердце, благоустраивает свою мирскую и Последнюю жизнь и обретает вечное счастье и великий удел. А лишаясь набожности и благочестия, человек обрекает себя на бесконечные несчастья и страдания. Вот почему Всевышний велел бояться Его. Поистине, Он сурово карает тех, кто не испытывает страха перед Ним и уступает своим низменным желаниям."

کے نان نفقہ اور دوسری معاشرتی ذمہ داریوں کی ادائیگی کے لیے بھی تھا۔ اس کے علاوہ اس میں حضور ﷺ کے قرابت داروں کی مد بھی رکھی گئی تاکہ آپ ﷺ اپنے قرابت داروں کے ساتھ حسن سلوک کے تقاضے پورے کرسکیں۔ اسی طرح اس مال میں ان تمام اقسام کے ناداروں اور محتاجوں کا بھی حق رکھا گیا جن کا ذکر اس آیت میں آیا ہے۔ { کَیْ لَا یَکُوْنَ دُوْلَۃًم بَیْنَ الْاَغْنِیَـآئِ مِنْکُمْج } ”تاکہ وہ تم میں سے مال داروں ہی کے درمیان گردش میں نہ رہے۔“ اللہ تعالیٰ چاہتا ہے کہ معاشرے میں دولت کی تقسیم منصفانہ ہو اور اس کی گردش کے ثمرات معاشرے کے تمام طبقات تک پہنچیں۔ یہ اسلامی معیشت کا بہت اہم اور بنیادی اصول ہے۔ اسی اصول کے تحت اللہ تعالیٰ نے مال فے زیادہ تر ناداروں اور محتاجوں کی محرومیوں کے ازالے کے لیے مختص فرما دیا۔ مالِ فے بھی اگر مال غنیمت کی طرح تقسیم کیا جاتا تو یہاں بھی سواروں کو دوہرا حصہ ملتا اور ظاہر ہے جس شخص کے پاس گھوڑا یا اونٹ ہے وہ تو پہلے ہی سے کچھ خوشحال ہے۔ تو اس تقسیم سے مال فے کا بھی زیادہ تر حصہ خوشحال لوگوں کو ہی ملتا۔ واضح رہے کہ اسلام کے نظام عدل و قسط میں تمام انسانوں کو معاشی طور پر برابر کردینے کا تصور نہیں پایا جاتا۔ ایسا ہونا عملی طور پر ممکن بھی نہیں۔ ظاہر ہے ایک سپاہی اور سپہ سالار کسی طرح بھی برابر نہیں ہوسکتے۔ یہی وجہ ہے کہ کمیونزم اپنے تمام تردعو وں اور انقلابی نعروں کے باوجود ایسی ”معاشی مساوات“ کی کوئی ہلکی سی جھلک بھی دنیا کو نہیں دکھا سکا۔ اس کے برعکس اسلام کا نظام معیشت معاشرے سے معاشی ناہمواریوں کو ختم کرنے اور امیر و غریب کے درمیان فرق و تفاوت کو کم سے کم کرنے پر زور دیتا ہے۔ اس کے لیے اسلام ہر وہ دروازہ بند کردینے کا حکم دیتا ہے جس کی وجہ سے چند ہاتھوں میں ارتکازِ دولت کا خدشہ ہو اور ہر وہ راستہ کھولنے کی حوصلہ افزائی کرتا ہے جس سے گردش دولت کا رُخ امراء سے غرباء کی طرف پھرنے اور معاشی محرومیوں کے ازالے کا امکان ہو۔ آج معاشی پیچیدگیوں کی وجہ سے جدید معاشرے میں جو گھمبیر صورتحال جنم لے رہی ہے اس کا ادراک سب سے پہلے جس عالم دین کو ہوا وہ شاہ ولی اللہ دہلوی - تھے۔ شاہ ولی اللہ رح ایسی صورت حال کے بارے میں فرماتے ہیں کہ جس ملک یا معاشرے میں تقسیم دولت کا نظام غیر منصفانہ ہوگا وہاں کچھ لوگ دولت کے انبار جمع کرکے مسرفانہ عیاشیوں اور بدمعاشیوں میں مبتلا ہوجائیں گے ‘ جبکہ محروم طبقے کے لوگ باربرداری کے جانور بن کر رہ جائیں گے۔ ایسی ہی صورت حال کے بارے میں حضور ﷺ کا فرمان ہے : کَادَ الْفَقْرُ اَنْ یَّـکُوْنَ کُفْرًا 1 کہ محرومی اور احتیاج انسان کو کفر تک پہنچا دیتی ہے۔ گویا تقسیم دولت کا غیر منصفانہ نظام ایسی دودھاری تلوار ہے جس کی دو طرفہ کاٹ سے مذکورہ دونوں طبقوں کے افراد مذہبی و انسانی اقدار سے بیگانہ و بےنیاز ہو کر عملی طور پر معاشرے کے لیے ناسور بن جاتے ہیں۔ اُمراء کو تو اپنے اللوں تللوں سے ہی فرصت نہیں ملتی جبکہ غریب و نادار عوام دنیا ومافیہا سے بیخبر صبح سے شام تک کمرتوڑ مشقت میں مصروف رہتے ہیں۔ اس صورت حال سے فائدہ اٹھاتے ہوئے شیطان اپنے ایجنڈے کی تکمیل کے لیے آگے بڑھتا ہے اور محروم طبقے کے افراد کے دلوں میں ظالم استحصالی طبقے کے خلاف بغض و عداوت کی آگ سلگانا شروع کردیتا ہے : { اِنَّمَا یُرِیْدُ الشَّیْطٰنُ اَنْ یُّوْقِـعَ بَـیْـنَـکُمُ الْعَدَاوَۃَ وَالْبَغْضَآئَ } المائدۃ : 91 ”شیطان تو یہ چاہتا ہے کہ تمہارے درمیان دشمنی اور بغض پیدا کر دے“۔ تصور کریں اگر ایک سیٹھ صاحب کی بیٹی کی شادی کے موقع پر کروڑوں روپے کا اسراف صرف بےجا نمود و نمائش کی مد میں ہو رہا ہوگا تو یہ سب کچھ دیکھ کر اس کے اس غریب ملازم کے دل میں نفرت و عداوت کے کیسے کیسے جذبات پیدا ہوں گے جس کی بیٹی گھر میں بیٹھی صرف اس لیے بوڑھی ہو رہی ہے کہ وہ اس کے ہاتھ پیلے کرنے کی استطاعت نہیں رکھتا۔ پھر ہمارے معاشرے میں جب ایک کروڑ پتی کی بیٹی لاکھوں کا جہیز لے کر دوسرے کروڑ پتی کی بہو بن جاتی ہے تو دولت مال داروں ہی کے مابین گردش میں رہتی ہے۔  { وَمَآ اٰتٰٹکُمُ الرَّسُوْلُ فَخُذُوْہُج وَمَا نَہٰٹکُمْ عَنْہُ فَانْتَہُوْاج } ”اور جو کچھ رسول ﷺ تم لوگوں کو دے دیں وہ لے لو اور جس چیز سے روک دیں اس سے رک جائو۔“ ان الفاظ میں گویا اہل ایمان کو ترغیب دی جا رہی ہے کہ وہ مال فے سے متعلق نئے قانون کے تحت رسول اللہ ﷺ کے فیصلوں کو بخوشی قبول کریں۔ ظاہر ہے لشکر اسلام میں شامل لوگ تو بنونضیر کے علاقے سے حاصل ہونے والے مال و اسباب کو مال غنیمت سمجھتے ہوئے اس میں سے حصے کی توقع کر رہے تھے۔ اب جب مذکورہ حکم کے تحت اس مال کو مال فے قرار دے کر اس کی تقسیم کا نیا قانون بنا دیا گیا تو لشکر کے شرکاء کو طبع بشری کے تحت ایک دھچکا تو ضرور لگا ہوگا۔ چناچہ اس حکم کے تحت بنونضیر کے محاصرے میں شامل اہل ایمان کو بالخصوص اور تمام اہل ایمان کو بالعموم دین کا بنیادی اصول بتادیا گیا کہ تمہارے لیے اللہ کے رسول ﷺ کا ہر فیصلہ آخری حکم کا درجہ رکھتا ہے۔ معاملہ چاہے کوئی بھی ہو ‘ اللہ کے رسول ﷺ تم لوگوں کو جو دے دیں وہ لے لیا کرو اور جس چیز سے آپ ﷺ منع کردیں اس سے منع ہوجایا کرو۔ { وَاتَّقُوا اللّٰہَط اِنَّ اللّٰہَ شَدِیْدُ الْعِقَابِ۔ } ”اور اللہ کا تقویٰ اختیار کرو۔ بیشک اللہ تعالیٰ سزا دینے میں بہت سخت ہے۔“ اب اگلی آیات میں مال فے کی تقسیم کے بارے میں مزید وضاحت کی جا رہی ہے کہ جب یہ مال مذکورہ قانون کے تحت بیت المال میں آجائے گا تو اس کی تقسیم میں بنیادی طور پر ضرورت مندوں کی ضروریات کو ترجیح دی جائے گی۔ ظاہر ہے اللہ کے رسول ﷺ تو اس میں سے اپنے اور اپنے گھر والوں کے لیے وہی کچھ قبول کریں گے جو آپ ﷺ کی انتہائی بنیادی ضروریات کے لیے ناگزیر ہوگا۔ آپ ﷺ نے تو اپنی ذات اور ازواجِ مطہرات - پر شروع دن سے ہی فقر طاری کر رکھا تھا۔ سورة الاحزاب کے چوتھے رکوع میں واقعہ ایلاء کے بارے میں ہم پڑھ آئے ہیں کہ ازواجِ مطہرات رض کی طرف سے نان نفقہ بڑھانے کے مطالبے پر حضور ﷺ نے ان رض سے علیحدگی اختیار فرما لی تھی۔ چناچہ مال فے کا بڑا حصہ کس کے لیے مختص کیا جائے گا :</p>"

عليه،<span class=\"blue\"> فقال:</span> إنه قد حضر أهل أبيات من قومك وإنا قد أمرنا لهم برضخ، فاقسمه بينهم،<span class=\"blue\"> فقلت:</span> يا أمير المؤمنين مر بذلك غيري،<span class=\"blue\"> قال:</span> اقبضه أيها المرء فبينا أنا كذلك، إذ جاء يرفأ مولاه،<span class=\"blue\"> فقال:</span> عبد الرحمن بن عوف، والزبير، وعثمان، وسعد يستأذنون،<span class=\"blue\"> فقال:</span> ائذن لهم؛ ثم مكث ساعة،<span class=\"blue\"> ثم جاء فقال:</span> هذا عليّ والعباس يستأذنان،<span class=\"blue\"> فقال:</span> ائذن لهما؛<span class=\"blue\"> فلما دخل العباس قال:</span> يا أمير المؤمنين اقض بيني وبين هذا الغادر الخائن الفاجر، وهما جاءا يختصمان فيما أفاء الله على رسوله من أعمال بني النضير،<span class=\"blue\"> فقال القوم:</span> اقض بينهما يا أمير المؤمنين، وأرح كلّ واحد منهما من صاحبه، فقد طالت خصومتهما،<span class=\"blue\"> فقال:</span> أنشدكم الله الذي بإذنه تقوم السماوات والأرض،<span class=\"blue\"> أتعلمون أن رسول الله صَلَّى الله عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم قال:</span> <span class=\"red\">\" لا نُورَثُ ما تَرَكْنَاهْ صَدَقَةٌ\"</span> قالوا: قد قال ذلك؛<span class=\"blue\"> ثم قال لهما:</span> أتعلمان أن رسول الله صَلَّى الله عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم قال ذلك؟ قالا نعم؛<span class=\"blue\"> قال:</span> فسأخبركم بهذا الفيء، إن الله خصّ نبيه صَلَّى الله عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم بشيء لم يعطه غيره،<span class=\"blue\"> فقال:</span> <span class=\"arabic qpc-hafs green\">( مَا أَفَاءَ اللَّهُ عَلَى

منها هذا المال، فكان رسول الله صَلَّى الله عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ينفق على أهله منه سنتهم، ثم يجعل ما بقي في مال الله، فإذَا كانت هذه الآية التي قبلها مضت، وذكر المال الذي خصّ الله به رسوله صَلَّى الله عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم، ولم يجعل لأحد معه شيئًا، وكانت هذه الآية خبرًا عن المال الذي جعله الله لأصناف شتى، كان معلومًا بذلك أن المال الذي جعله لأصناف من خلقه غير المال الذي جعله للنبيّ صَلَّى الله عَلَيْهِ

مسافروں کے لئے ہے تاکہ وہ تمہارے مالداروں ہی کے درمیان گردش نہ کرتا رہے۔ جو کچھ رسول تمہیں دے وہ لے لو اور جس چیز سے وہ تم کو روک دے اس سے رک جاؤ۔ اللہ سے ڈرو ، اللہ سخت سزا دینے والا ہے “۔</p><p>یہ آیت اس حکم کو بتارہی جس کا ذکر ہم نے پہلے کردیا ہے۔ اس حکم کی علت بیان کرتے ہوئے اس آیت میں یہ کہا گیا ہے کہ اس کی وجہ دراصل اسلام کے نظام اقتصادی کا ایک عظیم اصول ہے۔</p><p>کئی لا یکون ........................ منکم (95 : 7) ” تاکہ وہ تمہارے مالداروں کے درمیان میں گردش نہ کرتا رہے “۔ اور اس کی علت کے بیان میں سالام کے دستوری نظام کا ایک دوسرا اعلیٰ ترین اصول بیان کردیا۔</p><p>وما اتکم .................... فانتھوا (95 : 7) ” جو کچھ رسول تمہیں دے ، وہ لے لو ، اور جس چیز سے وہ تمہیں روک دے اس سے رک جاؤ “۔ اگرچہ یہ دو اصول فے کی تقسیم کے ضمن میں وارد ہیں لیکن اسلام کے اقتصادی نظام اور اسلام کے دستوری نظام میں یہ بہت اہم اصول ہیں اور ان دونوں ہی پر دراصل اسلام کا اقتصادی اور دستوری نظام قائم ہے۔</p><p>پہلا قاعدہ اسلام کا اقتصادی اصل الاصول ہے اور اسلام کے اقتصادی نظریات اس پر مبنی ہیں۔ اسلام انفرادی ملکیت کو تسلیم کرتا ہے لیکن انفرادی ملکیت پر یہ ایک پابندی اور چیک ہے۔ یعنی اسلام انفرادی ملکیت کو اس قدر وسیع آزادی نہیں دیتا کہ کچھ محدود مالدار لوگ ہی دراصل تمام دولت اور مفادات کو اپنی طرف سرمایہ کے زور سے کھینچ لیں۔ اور مال چند چوٹی کے لوگوں کے درمیان گردش کرے۔ اس لئے ہر وہ صورت حال جس کے اندر دولت صرف امراء کے درمیان گردش کرتی وہ اسلام کے نظریہ اقتصاد کے خلاف ہے۔ اور یہ اجتماعی عدل کے بھی خلاف ہے۔ اسلامی سوسائٹی کے اندر اجتماعی اور معاشی روابط اس طرح تشکیل پاتے ہیں کہ اس میں دولت چند محدود لوگوں ہی کے اندر گردش نہیں کرتی۔</p><p>اسلام نے اپنا اقتصادی نظام ان اصولوں کی بنیاد پر قائم کیا۔ اس نے زکوٰة فرض کی ، یہ اڑھائی فیصد اصل سرمایہ اور منافع دونوں پر عائد ہوتی ہے۔ اور 011 یا 021 تمام زرعی پیداواروں پر عائد ہوتا ہے۔ اسی طرح مویشیوں میں اور ان خزانوں میں جو زمین سے حاصل ہوتے ہیں۔ یہ شرح دراصل بہت ہی بڑی شرح ہے۔ پھر مجاہدین کے لئے 54 حصہ رکھا ہے خواہ فقیر ہوں یا غنی ہوں ، جبکہ فے صرف فقراء کے لئے رکھا ہے۔ اسی طرح اسلام نے زمین کی پیداوار کے اندر مالک اور مضارع کو شریک قرار دیا ہے اور امام کو یہ اختیار دیا کہ وہ لوگوں کی ضرورت سے زائد اموال ان سے لے کر فقراء میں تقسیم کردے۔ اور اگر بیت المال کو ضرورت ہو تو لوگوں کے اموال میں بیت المال کا حصہ مقرر کردے۔ پھر اسلام نے ذخیرہ اندوزی کو حرام قرار دیا ، ربا کو حرام قرار دیا اور ربا اور ذخیرہ اندوزی دونوں ہی اصل ذرائع ارتکاز دولت ہیں۔ غرض اسلام کا اقتصادی نظام اسی عظیم قاعدے پر قائم ہے کہ دولت چند اغنیاء کے اندر ہی گردش نہ کرے بلکہ تمام فقراء تک اس کا پھیلاؤ ہو۔ اور یہ قاعدہ انفرادی ملکیت پر حاوی ہے۔</p><p>اس طرح اسلام انفرادی ملکیت کی اجازت دیتا ہے لیکن اس کے باوجود وہ سرمایہ دارانہ نظام نہیں ہے۔ نہ سرمایہ دارانہ نظام اسلامی نظام سے ماخوذ ہے کیونکہ رہا اور ذخیرہ اندوزی کے سوا کوئی سرمایہ دارانہ نظام نہیں ہوتا۔ اسلامی نظام ایک خاص نظام ہے جو اللہ علیم وخبیر کی طرف سے ہے۔ یہ الگ پیدا ہوا ، الگ چلا ، اور آج بھی وہ تمام دوسرے اقتصادی نظاموں سے الگ تھلگ ہے۔ یہ ایک منفرد ، متوازن ، عادلانہ اور تمام حقوق وواجبات کا خیال رکھنے والا نظام ہے۔ اور یہ نظام اس کائنات کے ساتھ بھی ہم آہنگ ہے۔ اس لئے کہ اس کائنات کا خالق اللہ ہے ، انسان کا خالق اللہ ہے اور اس اقتصادی نظام کا خالق بھی اللہ ہے۔</p><p>دوسرا اصول اسلام کے دستوری نظام کا ہے کہ شریعت کا ماخذ خدا اور رسول اور قرآن اور سنت ہیں۔</p><p>وما اتکم .................... فانتھوا (95 : 7) ” جو کچھ رسول تمہیں دے ، وہ لے لو ، اور جس چیز سے وہ تمہیں روکے اس سے رک جاؤ “۔ اسلامی دستور اور قوانین کا یہ اصل الاصول ہے۔ اسلام کا قانونی نظام اس سے لیا گیا ہے کہ شریعت من جانب اللہ ہے اور اللہ کی جانب سے رسول لے کر آیا ہے۔ اور یہ قرآن اور سنت سے عبارت ہے۔ پوری امت مسلمہ معہ امام وقت مل کر بھی ان تعلیمات کی خلاف ورزی کے مجاز نہیں جو قرآن وسنت میں ہیں۔ اگر کوئی خلاف قرآن اور سنت قانون بنائے گا تو اس کی کوئی قانونی حیثیت نہ ہوگی کیونکہ اس قسم کا قانون اپنے پہلے جواز ہی کو کھو بیٹھتا ہے ۔ یہ نظریہ تمام انسانی ودساتیر اور قانون سازی کے نظریات سے یکسر مختلف ہے۔ کیونکہ ان نظریات کے مطابق قوم قانون سازی کا سرچشمہ ہوتی ہے۔ یوں کہ کوئی قوم جو قانون چاہے ، اپنے لئے بنا سکتی ہے۔ اور جو قوم جو چاہے دستور و قانون بنا دے۔ لہٰذا اسلامی دستور نظام اقتدار کا سرچشمہ قرآن وسنت ہیں۔ جن کو رسول اللہ ﷺ نے پیش فرمایا ہے۔ امام امت کا نائب ہے۔ نہ امام اور نہ قوم رسول اللہ کی لائی ہوئی شریعت محمدی کی مخالفت کے مجاز ہیں۔</p><p>اب اگر کوئی مسئلہ قرآن وسنت میں نہ ہو تو اسے قرآن وسنت کے دوسرے اصولوں کی روشنی میں یوں حل کیا جائے گا کہ اس سے قرآن وسنت میں موجود کسی اصول کی خلاف ورزی نہ ہوتی ہو۔ یہ اصول شریعت کے خلاف نہیں ہے بلکہ یہ بھی ایک شرعی اصول ہے۔ لہٰذا ہر صورت میں سرچشمہ قانون قرآن اور سنت ہیں۔ اور دوسرے قوانین وقواعد اسی وقت معتبر ہوں گے جب وہ قرآن اور سنت کے کسی مسلمہ قاعدے کے خلاف نہ ہوں۔ امت کا اقتدار اس قاعدے کے اندر محدود ہے۔ یاد رہے کہ امام امت بھی اسی قاعدے کا پابند ہے۔ یہ ایک منفرد نظام قانون ہے اور کسی انسانی سوسائٹی کے ہاں اس قسم کا کوئی قانون نظام نہیں ہے۔ یہ ایک ایسا نظام ہے جس میں قانونی نظام بھی نظام کائنات کی طرح ایک فطری نظام ہوتا ہے۔ جس طرح کائنات کے لئے اللہ نے نظام فطرت وضع کیا ہے۔ اسی طرح انسانوں کے لئے اللہ نے نظام شریعت وضع کیا ہے تاکہ انسان کا بنایا ہوا قانون نظام فطرت سے ٹکرانہ جائے اور جو قانون بھی آج تک انسانوں کے بنائے ہیں وہ نظام فطرت سے ٹکرائے ہیں۔</p><p>ان دونوں اصولوں کو اس آیت میں اللہ سے مربوط کیا گیا ہے اور لوگوں کو دعوت دی ہے کہ ان اطاعت میں وہ اللہ سے ڈریں۔</p><p>واتقو ................ العقاب (95 : 7) ” اللہ سے ڈرو ، اللہ سخت سزا دینے والا ہے “۔ یہ وہ بڑی ضمانت ہے جو اسلامی قانون کو حاصل ہے ، اس لئے اسے توڑنے کی کوئی بھی کوشش نہیں کرتا۔ نہ اس سے بھاگنے کی کوئی گنجائش ہے۔ کیونکہ مومنین کو علم ہے کہ اللہ تو دیکھتا ہے۔ اعمال سے خبردار ہے۔ تمام لوگوں کو اسی طرف لوٹنا ہے ، اور اگر خلاف ورزی کی گئی تو وہ سخت عذاب دینے والا ہے۔ ان کو معلوم ہے کہ مال کو پھیلانا ہے اور اسے دولتمندوں کے درمیان ہی گردش نہیں دینا ہے۔ اور شریعت کے جو احکام خدا اور رسول نے دیئے ہیں انہوں نے انہیں لینا ہے اور جس چیز سے منع کیا ہے اس سے منع ہونا ہے اور اس سلسلے میں کوئی سستی اور کوئی تسابل نہیں کرنا ہے کیونکہ انہوں نے اللہ کے سامنے جانا ہے۔</p><p>اب رسول اللہ نے اس فے کو مہاجرین میں تقسیم کیا اور صرف دو غریب انصاریوں کو اس میں شریک فرمایا۔ یہ ایک خاص اقدام تھا اور اس کا مقصد یہی تھا کہ دولت صرف دولت مندوں میں جمع نہ ہوجائے۔</p><p>کئی لا یکون .................... منکم (95 : 7) ” تاکہ وہ مالداروں کے درمیان ہی گردش نہ کرتا رہے “۔ حکم تو عام تھا کہ وہ فقراء کے لئے ہے خواہ مہاجر ہوں یا انصار یا بعد میں آنے والے ہوں ، چناچہ اگلی آیات میں اس پر بات ہوتی ہے۔</p><p>قرآن کریم احکام محض ایک خشک ایکٹ کی طرح بیان نہیں کرتا۔ وہ اسے زندہ اور عام بیان کے انداز میں دیتا ہے۔ وہ ایک زندہ حکم ہوتا ہے زندہ انسانوں پر نافذ ہوتا ہے اور حکم کے اندر ہی اس کے اخلاقی پہلو اور اسباب بھی دیئے جاتے ہیں۔</p>"

The word afa'a is derived from fai'un which means 'to return'. Thus the time of the afternoon when the shade of things returns to the east is referred to as fai'. The real ownership of the entire universe belongs to Allah. The ownership of things can be ascribed to human beings when Allah Himself declares them, through His Law, to be under the ownership of a human being. However, when people rebel against Allah, indulging in disbelief and shirk, their lives and properties are confiscated through properly constituted Authority and their ownership return to the Real Owner, Allah. From this point of view, all properties acquired from the unbelievers should be called fai'. However, the sacred Law of Shari` ah draws a distinction between the terms ghanimah [ spoils ] and fai'. The former refers to a property which is acquired from non-Muslims through active armed struggle, as in [ 8:41] وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا غَنِمْتُم مِّن شَيْءٍ (And know that whatever spoils you receive...). However, the word 'fai' refers to a property acquired without resorting to an actual fight, (like in a state of peaceful surrender.) These two terms have been used to set down rules of these two types in the Holy Qur'an. Surah Al-Anfal dealt with injunctions relating to ghanimah or spoils, which is acquired from non-Muslims in the wake of armed struggle. The present Surah takes up the subject of fai' and the law of its distribution. The term fai' includes any property or wealth which the non-Muslims might leave behind and run away, or make over to the Muslim Authority willingly or with consent like Khiraj, jizyah or commercial duty.</p><p>مَّا أَفَاءَ اللَّـهُ عَلَىٰ رَ‌سُولِهِ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَ‌ىٰ (Whatever fai' Allah has passed on to His Messenger ﷺ from the people of the towns... 59:7). The phrase ahl ul-qura or 'the people of the towns' refers to the Jewish tribes like Banu Nadir and Banu Quraizah whose wealth and property were obtained without armed struggle. The laws pertaining to the distribution of the two types of spoils are different. Unlike ghanimah [ spoils of war ], fai' is not distributed among the mujahidin (participants in fighting). The Holy Prophet ﷺ is granted full authority to give as much as he likes to whomsoever he likes or to retain for himself at his discretion. However, a few classes of beneficiaries have been clearly defined. The fai' must be distributed among the defined five classes.</p><p>The foregoing verses set down the rules pertaining to fai', its beneficiaries and its method of distribution. Some details are available at the beginning of Surah Al-Anfal in Volume 4 of Ma` ariful Qur'an, pages 148-151 and more details of the injunctions are available in the same volume on pages 221-229, under verse 41. It needs to be borne in mind that the wordings of Surah Al-Anfal regarding Khums [ 1/5th ] of ghanimah is almost identical to the wordings of fai' mentioned in the present verse. Let us compare: 8:41 reads: وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا غَنِمْتُم مِّن شَيْءٍ فَأَنَّ لِلَّـهِ خُمُسَهُ وَلِلرَّ‌سُولِ وَلِذِي الْقُرْ‌بَىٰ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينِ وَابْنِ السَّبِيلِ (And know that whatever spoils you receive, its one-fifth is for Allah and His Messenger and for kinsmen and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer... 8:41). Verse [ 7] of the present Surah reads as above which means: \"Whatever fai' Allah has passed on to His Messenger from the people of the towns is for Allah and for His Messenger ﷺ ، and for kinsmen and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer....59:7). In both these verses, six classes of beneficiaries are mentioned: Allah, the Messenger, kinsmen, orphans, the needy and the wayfarer. It is all too clear that Allah is the Real Owner and Master of this world, the next world and the entire creation. The name of Allah in relation to the shares has been mentioned by way of blessing or benediction, because the wealth or property thus associated with Allah's name attains honour and distinction. It also points to the permissibility and purity of the wealth. This is the view of Sayyidna Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, ` Ata', Ibrahim, Sha'bi رحمۃ اللہ علیہم and the commentators in general. [ Mazhari ]</p><p>In the commentary of Surah Al-Anfal, it was fully and exhaustively explained how wealth attains honour and distinction by the mention of Allah's name which, in brief, amounts to the following: The prophets are not allowed to avail of Sadaqat or charities, even though they are derived from the pure wealth of the Muslims. The question might arise how the ghanimah and fai' are made lawful for the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، while they are derived from the infidels? By mentioning Allah's name at the beginning of the verse, this doubt has been removed. The point is that Allah is the real owner of the entire universe. Human beings come to own certain things when Allah by His own grace declares for them to pass into human ownership. However, when a certain segment of human beings rebels against Allah, Jihad is waged against them by Allah's command, which means that, during the war, their lives and properties are no longer sacred. In this way, all their wealth is confiscated in the name of the Authority in command. The confiscated properties are named ghanimah, spoils or war booty - which goes out of the ownership of disbelievers and gets itself deposited separately as being under the ownership of Allah alone. And as stated earlier, the word fai' contains the meaning of 'return' and the wealth is so called because its ownership is restored to the original owner, Allah. No human being has any entitlement to it. The beneficiaries who will receive a share of it will receive it direct from Allah, and therefore it will be lawful and pure like water and self-growing grass which are direct Divine gift, lawful and pure.</p><p>In short, the mention of Allah's name in this context points to the fact that the entire wealth belongs to Allah, and it is granted to the beneficiaries on His behalf. It is no sadaqah or khairat [ charity ].</p><p>This leaves us with five classes of beneficiaries: [ 1] The Messenger ﷺ ; [ 2] kinsmen; [ 3] orphans; [ 4] the needy; and [ 5] the wayfarer. The same five classes of beneficiaries of khums [ 1/5th ] were determined in [ 8:41] and now the same classes of beneficiaries are determined for fai' property. The rules relating to both ghanimah and fai' properties are identical: They are in full authority of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ، and after him in the authority of the Caliphs. The Authority may retain them for the benefit of Muslims in general, or they may deposit them in bait-ul-mal [ public treasury ] and do not grant anything to anyone, or they may distribute them. If it is decided to be distributed, it must be done within the five classes defined. [ Qurtubi ]</p><p>Companions shows that fai' property was in the Authority of the Holy Prophet ﷺ during his time, and was left to his discretion. He may disburse it as he deemed fit. After him, his Caliphs controlled it and disbursed it according to their best judgment.</p><p>After the demise of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ، his share of the booty fell into disuse. The word 'Kinsmen' in the verse means the kinsmen of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . There were two reasons why they were granted a share from this booty: Firstly, because they helped the Holy Messenger ﷺ and supported him in his Islamic activities. Therefore, even the rich kinsmen of the Holy Prophet ﷺ used to be granted a share from the booty. [ 2] Sadaqah [ charity ] was unlawful for the Holy Prophet's ﷺ kinsmen. Therefore, the poor and needy relatives of the Holy Prophet ﷺ used to be granted a share from the fai' rather than from the Sadaqah [ charity ]. After the demise of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، helping and supporting him came to an end. The first reason no longer existed. Therefore, the share from the fai' of the rich relatives fell into disuse like that of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . However, the poor and the needy relatives continued to receive their share from the fai' on account of poverty and need. Priority was given to the poor and needy relatives of Allah's Messenger\tﷺ over other poor and needy people. [ Hidayah ]. See Ma’ ariful Qur’ an, Vol. 4/pp 228-229.</p><p>كَيْ لَا يَكُونَ دُولَةً بَيْنَ الْأَغْنِيَاءِ مِنكُمْ (...so that it may not circulate only between the rich among you\t59:7). The word dulatah refers to the 'wealth or good fortune that exchange hands'. [ Qurtubi ] The verse means that Allah has determined the heads of expenditure for the fai' in this way so that the wealth does not circulate among the wealthy, who would spend it as they wish and desire and give none of it to the poor. The verse is aimed at abolishing an old practice of the Days of Ignorance where the circulation of such wealth used to remain confined to the privileged and propertied class or caste. The poorer segment of the society had no entitlement to the wealth of the nation.</p><p>Effective Measures taken by Islam against concentration of wealth</p><p>Allah is the creator, cherisher and sustainer of the universe. He knows the human needs. All human beings, whether believers or non-believers, whether lineally rich or poor, are equal in the sight of Allah. Allah has to a very large extent kept the distribution of man's natural and basic needs in His own Hands, so that every class, every region, every weak and strong people might be able to benefit equally. Allah has, through His consummate wisdom, kept all such needs beyond man's personal domination. No human being dare take possession of these things personally. Air, wind, atmosphere, the Sun, the Moon, the light of the stars and planets, the rain-laden clouds - all these things are such without which no human can survive for a moment. Allah, the Almighty, has declared all natural resources a public endowment for all. Not even the greatest of sovereign authorities, by virtue of their ruling powers, can ever monopolize or take possession of them. Allah's creation avails of them equally everywhere.</p><p>The second category of necessities of life is what the earth produces, as for instance water and other food-stuff. This is not commonly available. However, Islamic law has declared hills and mountains, unpopulated jungles and natural springs as public endowments. However, legitimate right of ownership of some parts of the earth are allowed under special laws to specific human beings. Some people illegitimately grab the land, but naturally even the greatest capitalist cannot derive benefit from the land without the help of the poor, the farmers or the laborers. Thus despite a sort of ownership of it, he is forced to give shares to other powerless and the indigent.</p><p>The third category is gold, silver and money, which do not fall under the basic and natural necessities of life. But Allah has made them the means of acquiring all essentials of life. People who mine gold and silver from the ground become their owners subject to certain rules. The right of their ownership is transferred in various ways to other people. If they are widely distributed and are in easy circulation in human society, no individual will go without food and clothing. But what happens in our days is that the greedy people want to benefit from the wealth to the exclusion of others. This led to miserliness and greed which, in turn, led to some old and some new systems of monopolization and concentration of wealth. As a result, people's wealth concentrated in the hands of a few capitalists and people at the helm of affairs. The rest of the population who were poor and indigent had to suffer, because they were deprived of their share in the nation's wealth. This economic situation, as a reaction, gave birth to such unreasonable economic systems as communism and socialism.</p><p>Islamic economic system, on the one hand, shows the highest respect to individual property rights, in that an individual's lawful property is as sacred and inviolable as human life itself, and human life is as sacred and inviolable as the House of Allah. Its violation has been most strongly prohibited. On the other hand, if a hand filches or steals it, it is, under penal law, amputated. In the third place, all such doors have been shut, through which a particular individual or group of individuals might monopolize it and deprive the general public.</p><p>The unjust and unbalanced way of acquisition of wealth, such as by usury, speculation, gambling and betting, allows wealth to concentrate and circulate in the hands of a few individuals. Islam has declared all such gains as unlawful and cut at the root of all such transactions in trade and tenancy that are based on unlawful practices. Wealth that is gained through lawful means has specific ways of spending: The needy and the indigent are shareholders in the wealth in the form of Zakah, ` Ushr, Sadaqat-ul-Fitr [ Id charity ], various forms of expiation and so on. The surplus wealth may be given away in voluntary charity. If a man leaves behind assets at the time of his death, Divine wisdom has set down specific rules according to which it must be distributed. The shareholders in the assets are the relatives of the deceased, the principle in this case being al-'aqrab- fal-'aqrab, that is 'relatives in order of relationship'. In other words, Islamic law of succession is based on blood relationship; the nearer in degree to the deceased excludes the more remote. The needy in general have not been made the shareholders, because if that were the case, the dying person would have felt the need to spend his assets anyhow, rightly or wrongly, before his death. When he sees only his near and dear ones receiving, this urge does not develop in his heart.</p><p>This means of acquiring wealth blocks the way to monopolization. The second means of acquiring wealth is war and jihad. The gains made in this way are distributed according to the Islamic rules. Some of them have been set down in Surah Al-Anfal and others in this Surah. How unwise and short-sighted are those people who give up Islam's balanced system of economics based on justice, fair-play and compassion, and innovate new systems of wealth distribution, which are unjust and unbalanced, and disturb world peace?</p><p>وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّ‌سُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا وَاتَّقُوا اللَّـهَ (...Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it; and whatever thing he forbids you, abstain [ from it ]. And fear Allah....59:7). This verse is in connection with fai' property, and it purports to say that Allah has set down the beneficiaries of this property. However, the question which beneficiary will receive how much have been left to the discretion of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Therefore, the Muslims are advised to happily accept the amount the Holy Prophet ﷺ grants them, and they should not be anxious to receive what he has not given to them. This has been further emphasized by the injunction all (Fear Allah). If anyone collects under false pretext more than what he is granted, Allah is fully aware and will punish him.</p><p>The Messenger's Command is Binding like the Qur’ anic Command</p><p>Although the verse was revealed in connection with fai', its words are general. They are not specific to wealth. They cover all the commands as well. Hence, the generalized meaning of the verse is that whatever the Holy Prophet ﷺ gives to a person, be it wealth, any other grant or any command, the people must show their willingness to accept it. And whatever he forbids them, they should stay away from it.</p><p>Many of the Companions took the generalized sense of the verse, and on the basis of it, they took the Holy Prophet's ﷺ commandment as binding as the Qur'anic commandment. Qurtubi said that in this verse the antonym of ata [ gives ] is naha [ forbids ]. This shows that the verb ata [ gives ] is used in the sense of amara [ commands ] which is the direct antonym of naha [ forbids ]. The Qur'an, instead of using the direct opposite of naha [ forbids ] which is amara [ commands ], employed the verb ` ata [ gives ] presumably to embrace the context of the subject-matter where the verse occurs, that is, the disbursement of fai' property.</p><p>Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Masud ؓ once saw a person in the state of ihram wearing sewn clothes (which is impermissible in that state). He asked him to take off the clothes. The person asked him to recite a Qur'anic verse in support of his claim that a pilgrim is prohibited to put on a sewn garb. Sayyidna ` Abdullan Ibn Masud ؓ recited this very verse آتَاكُمُ الرَّ‌سُولُ فَخُذُوهُ (Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it....\".</p><p>Imam Shafi` i\t (رح) once said to his congregation: (Ask whatever question you wish, and I will answer from the Qur'an.) A person said that a pilgrim killed a wasp in the state of ihram and asked: \"What is the rule about it?\" Imam Shafi` i (رح) recited this verse of the Qur'an مَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّ‌سُولُ فَخُذُوهُ. (Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it....\" and coupled it with a Tradition which gives the injunction relating to the killing of a wasp. [ Qurtubi ].</p><p>لِلْفُقَرَ‌اءِ الْمُهَاجِرِ‌ينَ ([ And fai' is especially ] for the poor emigrants...[ 59:8] \". The few verses from here till the end of the section describe the poor emigrants (muhajirin), helpers (Ansar) and the general members of Ummah that were yet to come in this world. Grammatically, the prepositional phrase 'for the emigrants' is a complement to the prepositional phrase 'for the kinsmen' occurring in verse [ 7] [ Mazhari ]. What this verse purports to say is that although the beneficiaries of fai' are orphans, the needy and the wayfarers as mentioned in the preceding verse, priority and precedence will be given to those whose service to religion, personal qualities and religious perfection are well- known.</p><p>Priority should be given to the Indigent Righteous and Religious Scholars serving the Cause of Islam when distributing Charity</p><p>This shows that although charities, especially fai' are meant to fulfill the needs of the indigent Muslims in general, the righteous, especially students and learned scholars serving the cause of religion should be given priority over all others. This is the reason why Islamic governments gave allowance from the fai' fund to learned scholars, muftis and judges for serving the cause of education, propagation of Islam and reform of human beings, because these verses establish two categories of the noble Companions. Under the first category fall the emigrants who in the very first instance made great sacrifices for Islam and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ . They endured great hardships, and eventually bid farewell to their wealth and property, to their land and country, and to their relatives and the near and dear ones, and emigrated to Madinah. Under the second category fall the Ansar, the natives of Madinah who helped the emigrants and cooperated with them. They invited the Messenger of Allah and with him the emigrants and thus caused the whole world around them to stand in their opposition. Their hospitality is unparalleled in the annals of the nations of the world. After these two major categories, comes a third category which comprises those people who embraced Islam after the blessed Companions and followed their footsteps closely. The last category embraces all Muslims who will follow until the Last Hour. The three categories are discussed below, in succession.</p>"

بَيْنَ الْأَغْنِيَاءِ مِنْكُمْ وَمَا آَتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانْتَهُوا وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ (7){ مَّآ أَفَآءَ الله على رَسُولِهِ مِنْ أَهْلِ القرى فَلِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِى القربى واليتامى والمساكين وابن السبيل كَى لاَ يَكُونَ دُولَةً بَيْنَ الاغنيآء مِنكُمْ } .جمهور العلماء جعلوا هذه الآية ابتداء كلام ، أي على الاستئناف الابتدائي ، وأنها قصد منها حكم غير الحكم الذي تضمنته الآية التي قبلها . ومن هؤلاء مالك وهو قول الحنفية فجعلوا مضمون الآية التي قبلها أموالَ بني النضير خاصة ، وجعلوا الآية الثانية هذه إخباراً عن حكم الأَفيَاء التي حصلت عند فتح قرىً أخرى بعد غزوة بني النضير . مثل قريظة سنة خمس ، وفَدككٍ سنة سبع ، ونحوهما فعيّنته هذه الآية للأصناف المذكورة فيها ، ولا حق في ذلك لأهل الجيش أيضاً وهذا الذي يجري على وفاق كلام عمر بن الخطاب في قضائه بين العباس وعلي فيما بأيديهما من أموال بني النضير على احتمال فيه ، وهو الذي يقتضيه تغيير أسلوب التعْبير بقوله هنا : { ما أفاء الله على رسوله من أهل القرى } بعد أن قال في التي قبلها { وما أفاء الله على رسوله منهم } [ الحشر : 6 ] فإن ضمير { منهم } راجع ل { الذين كفروا من أهل الكتاب } [ الحشر : 2 ] وهم بنو النضير لا محالة . وعلى هذا القول يجوز أن تكون هذه الآية نزلت عقب الآية الأولى ، ويجوز أن تكون نزلت بعد مدة فإن فتح القُرى وقع بعد فتح النضير بنحو سنتين .ومن العلماء من جعل هذه الآية كلمة وبياناً للآية التي قبلها ، أي بياناً للإِجمال الواقع في قوله تعالى : { فما أوجفتم عليه من خيل } الآية [ الحشر : 6 ] ، لأن الآية التي قبلها اقتصرت على الإِعلام بأن أهل الجيْش لا حقّ لهم فيه ، ولم تبين مستحقَّه وأشعر قولُه { ولكن الله يسلط رسله على من يشاء } [ الحشر : 6 ] أنه مَالٌ لله تعالى يضعه حيث شاء على يد رسوله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقد بيّن الله له مستحقّيه من غير أهل الجيش . فموقع هذه الآية من التي قبلها موقع عطف البيان . ولذلك فصلت .وممن قال بهذا الشافعيّ وعليه جرى تفسير صاحب «الكشاف» . ومقتضى هذا أن تكون أموال بني النضير مما يُخَمّس ولم يرو أحد أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم خمّسها بل ثبت ضدُّه ، وعلى هذا يكون حكم أموال بني النضير حكماً خاصاً ، أو تكون هذه الآية ناسخة للآية التي قبلها إن كانت نزلت بعدها بمدة .قال ابن الفرس : آية { ما أفاء الله على رسوله من أهل القرى } . وهذه الآية من المشكلات إذا نُظرت مع الآية التي قبلها ومع آية الغنيمة من سورة الأنفال . ولا خلاف في أن قوله تعالى : { وما أفاء الله على رسوله منهم الآية } [ الحشر : 6 ] إنما نزلت فيما صار لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم من أموال الكفار بغير إيجاف ، وبذلك فسّرها عُمر ولم يخالفه أحد .وأما آية الأنفال فلا خلاف أنها نزلت فيما صار من أموال الكفار بإيجاف ، وأما الآية الثانية من الحشر فاختلف أهل العلم فيها فمنهم من أضافها إلى التي قبلها ، ومنهم من أضافها إلى آية الأنفال وأنهما نزلتا بحكمين مختلفين في الغنيمة الموجف عليها ، وأن آية الأنفال نسخت آية الحشر .ومنهم من قال : إنها نزلت في معنى ثالث غير المعنيين المذكورين في الآيتين : واختلف الذاهبون إلى هذا : فقيل نزلت في خراج الأرض والجزية دون بقية الأموال ، وقيل نزلت في حكم الأرض خاصة دون سائر أموال الكفار ( فتكون تخصيصاً لآية الأنفال ) وإلى هذا ذهب مالك . والآية عند أهل هذه المقالة غير منسوخة . ومنهم من ذهب إلى تخيير الإمام اه .والتعريف في قوله تعالى : { من أهل القرى } تعريف العهد وهي قرى معروفة عُدّت منها : قريظة ، وفَدَك ، وقرى عُرينة ، واليُنْبُع ، ووادي القُرى ، والصفراء ، فتحت في عهد النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم واختلف الناس في فتحها أكان عنوة أو صلحاً أو فَيئاً . والأكثر على أن فَدَك كانت مثل النضير .ولا يختص جعله للرسول بخصوص ذات الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم بل مثله فيه أيمة المسلمين .وتقييد الفيء بفيء القرى جَرى على الغالب لأن الغالب أن لا تفتح إلا القرى لأن أهلها يحاصَرون فيستسلمون ويعطُون بأيديهم إذا اشتد عليهم الحصار ، فأما النازلون بالبوادي فلا يُغلبون إلا بعد إيجاف وقتال فليس لقيد { من أهل القرى } مفهوم عندنا ، وقد اختلف الفقهاء في حكم الفيء الذي يحصل للمسلمين بدون إيجاف . فمذهب مالك أنه لا يخمَّس وإنما تخمس الغنائم وهي ما غنمه المسلمون بإيجاف وقتال .وذهب أبو حنيفة إلى التفصيل بين الأموال غير الأرضين وبين الأرضين . فأما غير الأرضين فهو مخمّس ، وأما الأرضون فالخيار فيها للإِمام بما يراه أصلح إن شاء قسّمها وخمس أهلها فهم أرقاء ، وإن شاء تركها على ملك أهلها وجعل خراجاً عليها وعلى أنفسهم .وذهب الشافعي إلى أن جميع أموال الحرب مخمّسة وحمل حكم هاته الآية على حكم آية سورة الأنفال بالتخصيص أو بالنسخ .وذهب أبو حنيفة إلى التفصيل بين الأموال غير الأرضين وبين الأرضين . فأما غير الأرضين فهو مخمّس ، وأما الأرضون فالتفويض فيها للإِمام بما يراه أصلح إن شاء قسّمها وخمس أهلها فهم أرقاء ، وإن شاء أقرّ أهلها بها وجعل خراجاً عليها وعلى أنفسهم .وهذه الآية اقتضت أن صنفاً مما أفاء الله على المسلمين لم يجعل الله فيه نصيباً للغزاة وبذلك تحصل معارضة بين مقتضاها وبين قصر آية الأنفال التي لم تجعل لمن ذكروا في هذه الآية إلا الخمس ، فقال جمع من العلماء : إن آية الأنفال نسخت حكم هذه الآية . وقال جمع : هذه الآية نسخت آيةَ الأنفال .وقال قتادة : كانت الغنائم في صدر الإِسلام لهؤلاء الأصناف الخمسة ثم نسخ ذلك بآية الأنفال ، وبذلك قال زيد بن رومان : قال القرطبي ونحوه عن مالك ا ه . على أن سورة الأنفال سابقة في النزول على سورة الحشر لأن الأنفال نزلت في غنائم بدر وسورة الحشر نزلت بعدها بسنتين .إلا أن يقول قائل : إن آية الأنفال نزلت بعد آية الحشر تجديداً لما شرعه الله من التخميس في غنائم بدر ، أي فتكون آية الحشر ناسخة لما فعله رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم في قسمة مغانم بدر ، ثم نسخت آية الأنفال آية الحشر . فيكون إلحاقها بسورة الأنفال بتوقيف من النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وقال القرطبي : قيل إن سورة الحشر نزلت بعد الأنفال ، واتفقوا على أن تخميس الغنائم هو الذي استقر عليه العمل ، أي بفعل النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وبالإِجماع .وليس يبعد عندي أن تكون القرى التي عنتها آية الحشر فتحت بحالة مترددة بين مجرد الفيء وبين الغنيمة ، فشُرع لها حكم خاص بها ، وإذ قد كانت حالتها غير منضبطة تعذر أن نقيس عليها ونُسخ حكمها واستقرّ الأمر على انحصار الفتوح في حالتين : حالة الفيء المجرد وما ليس مجردَ فيء . وسقط حكم آية الحشر بالنسخ أو بالإِجماع . والإِجماع على مخالفة حكم النص يعتبر ناسخاً لأنه يتضمن ناسخاً . وعن معمر أنه قال : بلغني أن هذه الآية أي آية { ما أفاء الله على رسوله من أهل القرى } نزلت في أرض الخراج والجزْية .ومن العلماء من حملها على أرض الكفار إذا أخذت عنوة مثل سواد العراق دون ما كان من أموالهم غير أرض . كل ذلك من الحيرة في الجمع بين هذه الآية وآية سورة الأنفال مع أنها متقدمة على هذه مع ما روي عن عمر في قضية حكمه بين العباس وعلي ، ومع ما فعله عُمر في سواد العراق ، وقد عرفت موقع كل . وستعرف وجه ما فعله عمر في سواد العراق عند الكلام على قوله تعالى : { والذين جاؤوا من بعدهم } [ الحشر : 10 ] .ومن العلماء من جعل محمل هذه الآية على الغنائم كلها بناء على تفسيرهم الفيء بما يرادف الغنيمة . وزعموا أنها منسوخة بآية الأنفال . وتقدم ما هو المراد من ذكر اسم الله تعالى في عداد من لهم المغانم والفيءُ والأصناف المذكورة في هذه الآية تقدم بيانها في سورة الأنفال .و { كي لا يكون دولة } الخ تعليل لما اقتضاه لام التمليك من جعله ملكاً لأصناف كثيرة الأفراد ، أي جعلناه مقسوماً على هؤلاء لأجل أن لا يكون الفيء دُولة بين الأغنياء من المسلمين ، أي لئلا يتداوله الأغنياء ولا ينال أهلَ الحاجة نصيب منه .والمقصود من ذلك . إبطال ما كان معتاداً في العرب قبل الإِسلام من استئثار قائد الجيش بأمور من المغانم وهي : المرباع ، والصفايا ، وما صالح عليه عدوّه دون قتال ، والنشيطة ، والفضول .قال عبد الله بن عَنمة الضبّيّ يخاطب بِسطام بنَ قيس سيد بني شيبان وقائدَهم في أيامهم :لك المِرباع منها والصفايا ... وحُكْمك والنشيطَةُ والفُضُولفالمرباع : ربُع المغانم كان يستأثر به قائد الجيش .والصفايا : النفيس من المغانم الذي لا نظير له فتتعذر قسمته ، كان يستأثر به قائد الجيش ، وأما حُكمه فهو ما أعطاه العدوُّ من المال إذا نزلوا على حكم أمير الجيش .والنشيطة : ما يصيبه الجيش في طريقه من مال عدوّهم قبل أن يصلوا إلى موضع القتال .والفُضُول : ما يبْقى بعد قسمة المغانم مما لا يقبل القسمة على رؤوس الغُزاة مثل بعيرٍ وفرس .وقد أبطل الإِسلام ذلك كله فجعل الفيء مصروفاً إلى ستة مصارف راجعة فوائدها إلى عموم المسلمين لسدّ حاجاتهم العامة والخاصة ، فإن ما هو لله وللرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم إنما يجعله الله لما يأمر به رسوله صلى الله عليه وسلم وجعل الخمس من المغانم كذلك لتلك المصارف .وقد بدا من هذا التعليل أن من مقاصد الشريعة أن يكون المال دُولة بين الأمة الإِسلامية على نظام محكم في انتقاله من كل مال لم يسبق عليه ملك لأحد مثل المَوات ، والفيء ، واللقطات ، والركاز ، أو كان جزءاً معيناً مثل : الزكاة ، والكفارات ، وتخميس المغانم ، والخراج ، والمواريث ، وعقود المعاملات التي بين جانبي مال وعمل مثل : القراض والمغارسة ، والمساقاة ، وفي الأموال التي يظفر بها الظافر بدون عمل وسعي مثل : الفيء والرّكاز ، وما ألقاه البحر ، وقد بينت ذلك في الكتاب الذي سميتُه «مقاصد الشريعة الإِسلامية» .والدُولة بضم الدال : ما يتداوله المتداولون . والتداول : التعاقب في التصرف في شيء . وخصها الاستعمال بتداول الأموال .والدَولة بفتح الدال : النوبة في الغلبة والملك . ولذلك أجمع القراء المشهورون على قراءتها في هذه الآية بضم الدال .وقرأ الجمهور { كي لا يكون دولة } بنصب { دولةً } على أنه خبر { يكون } . واسم { يكون } ضمير عائد إلى ما أفاء الله ، وقرأه هشام عن ابن عامر ، وأبو جعفر برفع { دولةٌ } على أنَّ { يكون } تامة و { دولةٌ } فاعله .وقرأ الجمهور { يكون } بتحتية في أوله . وقرأه أبو جعفر { تكونَ } بمثناة فوقية جرياً على تأنيث فاعله . واختلف الرواة عن هشام فبعضهم روى عنه موافقة ( أي جعفر ) في تاء { تكون } وبعضهم روى عنه موافقة الجمهور في الياء .والخطاب في قوله تعالى : { بين الأغنياء منكم } للمسلمين لأنهم الذين خوطبوا في ابتداء السورة بقوله : { ما ظننتم أن يخرجوا } [ الحشر : 2 ] ثم قوله : { ما قطعتم من لينة } [ الحشر : 5 ] وما بعده . وجعله ابن عطية خطاباً للأنصار لأن المهاجرين لم يكن لهم في ذلك الوقت غنى .والمراد ب { الأغنياء } الذين هم مظنة الغنى ، وهم الغُزاة لأنهم أغنياء بالمغانم والأنفال .{ مِنكُمْ وَمَآ ءاتاكم الرسول فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نهاكم عَنْهُ فانتهوا واتقوا الله إِنَّ الله شَدِيدُ } .اعتراض ذيّل به حكم فَيْء بني النضير إذ هو أمر بالأخذ بكل ما جاء به الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ومما جاءت به هذه الآيات في شأن فيْء النضير ، والواو اعتراضية ، والقصد من هذا التذييل إزالة ما في نفوس بعض الجيش من حزازة حرمانهم مما أفاء الله على رسوله صلى الله عليه وسلم من أرض النضير .والإِيتاء مستعار لتبليغ الأمر إليهم ، جعل تشريعه وتبليغه كإيتاء شيء بأيديهم كما قال تعالى : { خذوا ما آتيناكم بقوة } [ البقرة : 63 و93 ] واستعير الأخذ أيضاً لقبول الأمر والرضى به والعمل .وقرينة ذلك مقابلته بقوله تعالى : { وما نهاكم عنه فانتهوا } وهو تتميم لنوعي التشريع . وهذه الآية جامعة للأمر باتباع ما يصدر من النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم من قول وفعل فيندرج فيها جميع أدلة السنة . وفي «الصحيحين» عن ابن مسعود : أنه قال : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم \" لعن الله الواشمات والمستوشمات \" . الحديث . فبلغ ذلك امرأة من بني أسد يقال لها : أم يعقوب فجاءته فقالت : بلغني أنك لعنت كيت وكيت فقال لها : وما لي لا ألعن من لعن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وهو في كتاب الله؟ فقالت : لقد قرأت ما بين اللوحين فما وجدت فيه ما تقول . فقال : لئن كنت قرأتيه لقد وجدتيه ، أما قرأتِ : { وما آتاكم الرسول فخذوه وما نهاكم عنه فانتهوا } .وعطف على هذا الأمر تحذير من المخالفة فأمرهم بتقوى الله فيما أمر به على لسان رسوله صلى الله عليه وسلم وعطف الأمر بالتقوى على الأمر بالأخذ بالأوامر وترك المنهيات يدل على أن التقوى هي امتثال الأمر واجتناب النهي .والمعنى : واتقوا عقاب الله لأن الله شديد العقاب ، أي لمن خالف أمره واقتحم نهيه ."

            "text": "قوله تعالى : ما أفاء الله على رسوله من أهل القرى قال ابن عباس : هي قريظة والنضير ، وهما بالمدينة وفدك ، وهي على ثلاثة أيام من المدينة وخيبر . وقرى عرينة وينبع جعلها الله لرسوله . وبين أن في ذلك المال الذي خصه بالرسول عليه السلام سهمانا لغير الرسول نظرا منه لعباده . وقد تكلم العلماء في هذه الآية والتي قبلها ، هل معناهما واحد أو مختلف ، والآية التي في الأنفال ; فقال قوم من العلماء : إن قوله تعالى : ما أفاء الله على رسوله من أهل القرى [ ص: 14 ] منسوخ بما في سورة الأنفال من كون الخمس لمن سمي له ، والأخماس الأربعة لمن قاتل . وكان في أول الإسلام تقسم الغنيمة على هذه الأصناف ولا يكون لمن قاتل عليها شيء . وهذا قول يزيد بن رومان وقتادة وغيرهما . ونحوه عن مالك . وقال قوم : إنما غنم بصلح من غير إيجاف خيل ولا ركاب ; فيكون لمن سمى الله تعالى فيه فيئا والأولى للنبي صلى الله عليه وسلم خاصة ، إذا أخذ منه حاجته كان الباقي في مصالح المسلمين . وقال معمر : الأولى للنبي صلى الله عليه وسلم . والثانية هي الجزية والخراج للأصناف المذكورة فيه . والثالثة الغنيمة في سورة الأنفال للغانمين . وقال قوم منهم الشافعي : إن معنى الآيتين واحد ; أي ما حصل من أموال الكفار بغير قتال قسم على خمسة أسهم ; أربعة منها للنبي صلى الله عليه وسلم . وكان الخمس الباقي على خمسة أسهم : سهم لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أيضا وسهم لذوي القربى - وهم بنو هاشم وبنو المطلب - لأنهم منعوا الصدقة فجعل لهم حق في الفيء . وسهم لليتامى . وسهم للمساكين . وسهم لابن السبيل . وأما بعد وفاة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فالذي كان من الفيء لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يصرف عند الشافعي في قول إلى المجاهدين المترصدين للقتال في الثغور ; لأنهم القائمون مقام الرسول عليه الصلاة والسلام . وفي قول آخر له : يصرف إلى مصالح المسلمين من سد الثغور وحفر الأنهار وبناء القناطر ; يقدم الأهم فالأهم ، وهذا في أربعة أخماس الفيء . فأما السهم الذي كان له من خمس الفيء والغنيمة فهو لمصالح المسلمين بعد موته صلى الله عليه وسلم بلا خلاف ; كما قال عليه الصلاة والسلام : \" ليس لي من غنائمكم إلا الخمس ، والخمس مردود فيكم \" . وقد مضى القول فيه في سورة \" الأنفال \" . وكذلك ما خلفه من المال غير موروث ، بل هو صدقة يصرف عنه إلى مصالح المسلمين ; كما قال عليه السلام : \" إنا لا نورث ، ما تركناه صدقة \" . وقيل : كان مال الفيء لنبيه صلى الله عليه وسلم ، لقوله تعالى : ما أفاء الله على رسوله فأضافه إليه ; غير أنه كان لا يتأثل مالا ، إنما كان يأخذ بقدر حاجة عياله ويصرف الباقي في مصالح المسلمين . قال القاضي أبو بكر بن العربي : لا إشكال أنها ثلاثة معان في ثلاث آيات ; أما الآية الأولى فهي قوله : هو الذي أخرج الذين كفروا من أهل الكتاب من ديارهم لأول الحشر ثم قال تعالى : وما أفاء الله على رسوله منهم يعني من أهل الكتاب معطوفا عليهم . فما أوجفتم عليه من خيل ولا ركاب يريد كما بينا ; فلا حق لكم فيه ، ولذلك قال عمر : إنها كانت خالصة [ ص: 15 ] لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ، يعني بني النضير وما كان مثلها . فهذه آية واحدة ومعنى متحد . الآية الثانية : قوله تعالى : ما أفاء الله على رسوله من أهل القرى فلله وللرسول وهذا كلام مبتدأ غير الأول لمستحق غير الأول . وسمى الآية الثالثة آية الغنيمة ، ولا شك في أنه معنى آخر باستحقاق ثان لمستحق آخر ، بيد أن الآية الأولى والثانية اشتركتا في أن كل واحدة منهما تضمنت شيئا أفاءه الله على رسوله ، واقتضت الآية الأولى أنه حاصل بغير قتال ، واقتضت آية الأنفال أنه حاصل بقتال ، وعريت الآية الثالثة وهي قوله تعالى : ما أفاء الله على رسوله من أهل القرى عن ذكر حصوله بقتال أو بغير قتال ; فنشأ الخلاف من هاهنا ، فمن طائفة قالت : هي ملحقة بالأولى ، وهو مال الصلح كله ونحوه . ومن طائفة قالت : هي ملحقة بالثانية وهي آية الأنفال . والذين قالوا إنها ملحقة بآية الأنفال اختلفوا ; هل هي منسوخة - كما تقدم - أو محكمة ؟ وإلحاقها بشهادة الله بالتي قبلها أولى ; لأن فيه تجديد فائدة ومعنى . ومعلوم أن حمل الحرف من الآية فضلا عن الآية على فائدة متجددة أولى من حمله على فائدة معادة . وروى ابن وهب عن مالك في قوله تعالى : فما أوجفتم عليه من خيل ولا ركاب بني النضير ، لم يكن فيها خمس ولم يوجف عليها بخيل ولا ركاب . كانت صافية لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فقسمها بين المهاجرين وثلاثة من الأنصار ; حسب ما تقدم . وقوله : ما أفاء الله على رسوله من أهل القرى هي قريظة ، وكانت قريظة والخندق في يوم واحد . قال ابن العربي : قول مالك إن الآية الثانية في بني قريظة ، إشارة إلى أن معناها يعود إلى آية الأنفال ، ويلحقها النسخ . وهذا أقوى من القول بالإحكام . ونحن لا نختار إلا ما قسمنا ، وبينا أن الآية الثانية لها معنى مجدد حسب ما دللنا عليه . والله أعلم .قلت : ما اختاره حسن . وقد قيل إن سورة \" الحشر \" نزلت بعد الأنفال ، فمن المحال أن ينسخ المتقدم المتأخر . وقال ابن أبي نجيح : المال ثلاثة : مغنم ، أو فيء ، أو صدقة ، وليس منه درهم إلا وقد بين الله موضعه . وهذا أشبه .الأموال التي للأئمة والولاة فيها مدخل ثلاثة أضرب : ما أخذ من المسلمين على طريق التطهير لهم ; كالصدقات والزكوات . والثاني : الغنائم ; وهو ما يحصل في أيدي المسلمين من أموال الكافرين بالحرب والقهر والغلبة . والثالث : الفيء ، وهو ما رجع للمسلمين من أموال الكفار عفوا صفوا من غير قتال ولا إيجاف ; كالصلح والجزية والخراج والعشور المأخوذة من تجار الكفار . ومثله أن يهرب المشركون ويتركوا أموالهم ، أو يموت أحد منهم في دار الإسلام ولا وارث له . فأما الصدقة فمصرفها الفقراء والمساكين والعاملين عليها ; [ ص: 16 ] حسب ما ذكره الله تعالى ، وقد مضى في \" براءة \" . وأما الغنائم فكانت في صدر الإسلام للنبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يصنع فيها ما شاء ; كما قال في سورة \" الأنفال \" : قل الأنفال لله والرسول ، ثم نسخ بقوله تعالى : واعلموا أنما غنمتم من شيء الآية . وقد مضى في الأنفال بيانه . فأما الفيء فقسمته وقسمة الخمس سواء . والأمر عند مالك فيهما إلى الإمام ، فإن رأى حبسهما لنوازل تنزل بالمسلمين فعل ، وإن رأى قسمتهما أو قسمة أحدهما قسمه كله بين الناس ، وسوى فيه بين عربيهم ومولاهم . ويبدأ بالفقراء من رجال ونساء حتى يغنوا ، ويعطوا ذوو القربى من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم من الفيء سهمهم على ما يراه الإمام ، وليس له حد معلوم . واختلف في إعطاء الغني منهم ; فأكثر الناس على إعطائه لأنه حق لهم . وقال مالك : لا يعطى منه غير فقرائهم ، لأنه جعل لهم عوضا من الصدقة . وقال الشافعي : أيما حصل من أموال الكفار من غير قتال كان يقسم في عهد النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم على خمسة وعشرين سهما : عشرون للنبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يفعل فيها ما يشاء ، والخمس يقسم على ما يقسم عليه خمس الغنيمة . قال أبو جعفر أحمد بن الداودي : وهذا قول ما سبقه به أحد علمناه ، بل كان ذلك خالصا له ; كما ثبت في الصحيح عن عمر مبينا للآية . ولو كان هذا لكان قوله : خالصة لك من دون المؤمنين يدل على أنه يجوز الموهوبة لغيره ، وأن قوله : خالصة يوم القيامة يجوز أن يشركهم فيها غيرهم . وقد مضى قول الشافعي مستوعبا في ذلك والحمد لله . ومذهب الشافعي رضي الله عنه : أن سبيل خمس الفيء سبيل خمس الغنيمة ، وأن أربعة أخماسه كانت للنبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ، وهي بعده لمصالح المسلمين . وله قول آخر : أنها بعده للمرصدين أنفسهم للقتال بعده خاصة ; كما تقدم .قال علماؤنا : ويقسم كل مال في البلد الذي جبي فيه ، ولا ينقل عن ذلك البلد الذي جبي فيه حتى يغنوا ، ثم ينقل إلى الأقرب من غيرهم ، إلا أن ينزل بغير البلد الذي جبي فيه فاقة شديدة ، فينتقل ذلك إلى أهل الفاقة حيث كانوا ، كما فعل عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه في أعوام الرمادة ، وكانت خمسة أعوام أو ستة . وقد قيل عامين ، وقيل : عام فيه اشتد الطاعون مع الجوع . وإن لم يكن ما وصفنا ، ورأى الإمام إيقاف الفيء أوقفه لنوائب المسلمين ، ويعطي منه المنفوس ويبدأ بمن أبوه فقير . والفيء حلال للأغنياء . ويسوي بين الناس فيه إلا أنه يؤثر أهل الحاجة والفاقة . والتفضيل فيه إنما يكون على قدر الحاجة . ويعطى منه الغرماء ما يؤدون به ديونهم . ويعطي منه الجائزة والصلة إن كان ذلك أهلا ، ويرزق القضاة والحكام ومن [ ص: 17 ] فيه منفعة للمسلمين . وأولاهم بتوفر الحظ منهم أعظمهم للمسلمين نفعا . ومن أخذ من الفيء شيئا في الديوان كان عليه أن يغزو إذا غزى .قوله تعالى : كي لا يكون دولة قراءة العامة يكون بالياء .دولة بالنصب ، أي كي لا يكون الفيء دولة ، وقرأ أبو جعفر والأعرج وهشام - عن ابن عامر - وأبو حيوة \" تكون \" بتاء \" دولة \" بالرفع ، أي كي لا تقع دولة . فكان تامة . و \" دولة \" رفع على اسم كان ولا خبر له . ويجوز أن تكون ناقصة وخبرها بين الأغنياء منكم وإذا كانت تامة فقوله : بين الأغنياء منكم متعلق ب \" دولة \" على معنى : تداول بين الأغنياء منكم . ويجوز أن يكون بين الأغنياء منكم وصفا ل \" دولة \" . وقراءة العامة دولة بضم الدال . وقرأها السلمي وأبو حيوة بالنصب . قال عيسى بن عمر ويونس والأصمعي : هما لغتان بمعنى واحد . وقال أبو عمرو بن العلاء : الدولة ( بالفتح ) الظفر في الحرب وغيره ، وهي المصدر . وبالضم اسم الشيء الذي يتداول من الأموال . وكذا قال أبو عبيدة : الدولة اسم الشيء الذي يتداول . والدولة الفعل . ومعنى الآية : فعلنا ذلك في هذا الفيء ، كي لا تقسمه الرؤساء والأغنياء والأقوياء بينهم دون الفقراء والضعفاء ، لأن أهل الجاهلية كانوا إذا غنموا أخذ الرئيس ربعها لنفسه ، وهو المرباع . ثم يصطفي منها أيضا بعد المرباع ما شاء ; وفيها قال شاعرهم : لك المرباع منها والصفايا يقول : كي لا يعمل فيه كما كان يعمل في الجاهلية . فجعل الله هذا لرسوله صلى الله عليه وسلم ; يقسمه في المواضع التي أمر بها ليس فيها خمس ، فإذا جاء خمس وقع بين المسلمين جميعا .قوله تعالى : وما آتاكم الرسول فخذوه وما نهاكم عنه فانتهوا أي ما أعطاكم من مال الغنيمة فخذوه ، وما نهاكم عنه من الأخذ والغلول فانتهوا ; قاله الحسن وغيره . السدي : ما أعطاكم من مال الفيء فاقبلوه ، وما منعكم منه فلا تطلبوه . وقال ابن جريج : ما آتاكم من طاعتي فافعلوه ، وما نهاكم عنه من معصيتي فاجتنبوه . الماوردي : وقيل إنه محمول على العموم في جميع أوامره ونواهيه ; لا يأمر إلا بصلاح ولا ينهى إلا عن فساد .قلت : هذا هو معنى القول الذي قبله . فهي ثلاثة أقوال .قال المهدوي : قوله تعالى : وما آتاكم الرسول فخذوه وما نهاكم عنه فانتهوا هذا يوجب أن كل ما أمر به النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم أمر من الله تعالى . والآية وإن كانت في الغنائم [ ص: 18 ] فجميع أوامره صلى الله عليه وسلم ونواهيه دخل فيها . وقال الحكم بن عمير - وكانت له صحبة - قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم : \" إن هذا القرآن صعب مستصعب عسير على من تركه ، يسير على من اتبعه وطلبه ، وحديثي صعب مستصعب وهو الحكم ، فمن استمسك بحديثي وحفظه نجا مع القرآن ، ومن تهاون بالقرآن وحديثي خسر الدنيا والآخرة . وأمرتم أن تأخذوا بقولي وتكتنفوا أمري وتتبعوا سنتي ، فمن رضي بقولي فقد رضي بالقرآن ، ومن استهزأ بقولي فقد استهزأ بالقرآن \" قال الله تعالى : وما آتاكم الرسول فخذوه وما نهاكم عنه فانتهوا .قال عبد الرحمن بن زيد : لقي ابن مسعود رجلا محرما وعليه ثيابه فقال له : انزع عنك هذا . فقال الرجل : أتقرأ علي بهذا آية من كتاب الله تعالى ؟ قال : نعم ، وما آتاكم الرسول فخذوه وما نهاكم عنه فانتهوا . وقال عبد الله بن محمد بن هارون الفريابي : سمعت الشافعي رضي الله عنه يقول : سلوني عما شئتم أخبركم من كتاب الله تعالى وسنة نبيكم صلى الله عليه وسلم ; قال : فقلت له : ما تقول - أصلحك الله - في المحرم يقتل الزنبور ؟ قال : فقال : بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم ، قال الله تعالى : وما آتاكم الرسول فخذوه وما نهاكم عنه فانتهوا وحدثنا سفيان بن عيينة عن عبد الملك بن عمير عن ربعي بن حراش عن حذيفة بن اليمان قال : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : \" اقتدوا باللذين من بعدي أبي بكر وعمر \" . حدثنا سفيان بن عيينة عن مسعر بن كدام عن قيس بن مسلم عن طارق بن شهاب عن عمر بن الخطاب - رضي الله عنه - أنه أمر بقتل الزنبور . قال علماؤنا : وهذا جواب في نهاية الحسن ، أفتى بجواز قتل الزنبور في الإحرام ، وبين أنه يقتدي فيه بعمر ، وأن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم أمر بالاقتداء به ، وأن الله سبحانه أمر بقبول ما يقوله النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ; فجواز قتله مستنبط من الكتاب والسنة . وقد مضى هذا المعنى من قول عكرمة حين سئل عن أمهات الأولاد فقال : هن أحرار في سورة \" النساء \" عند قوله تعالى : أطيعوا الله وأطيعوا الرسول وأولي الأمر منكم . وفي صحيح مسلم وغيره عن علقمة عن [ ص: 19 ] ابن مسعود قال : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : \" لعن الله الواشمات والمستوشمات ، والمتنمصات ، والمتفلجات للحسن المغيرات خلق الله \" . فبلغ ذلك امرأة من بني أسد يقال لها أم يعقوب ; فجاءت فقالت : بلغني أنك لعنت كيت وكيت ! فقال : وما لي لا ألعن من لعن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وهو في كتاب الله ! فقالت : لقد قرأت ما بين اللوحين فما وجدت فيه ما تقول . فقال : لئن كنت قرأتيه لقد وجدتيه ! أما قرأت وما آتاكم الرسول فخذوه وما نهاكم عنه فانتهوا ! قالت : بلى . قال : فإنه قد نهى عنه . . . . . الحديث . وقد مضى القول فيه في \" النساء \" مستوفى .قوله تعالى : وما آتاكم الرسول فخذوه وإن جاء بلفظ الإيتاء وهو المناولة فإن معناه الأمر .وما نهاكم عنه فانتهوا فقابله بالنهي ، ولا يقابل النهي إلا بالأمر ; والدليل على فهم ذلك ما ذكرناه قبل مع قوله عليه الصلاة والسلام : \" إذا أمرتكم بأمر فأتوا منه ما استطعتم ، وإذا نهيتكم عن شيء فاجتنبوه \" . وقال الكلبي : إنها نزلت في رؤساء المسلمين ، قالوا فيما ظهر عليه رسول الله من أموال المشركين : يا رسول الله ، خذ صفيك والربع ، ودعنا والباقي ; فهكذا كنا نفعل في الجاهلية . وأنشدوه :لك المرباع منها والصفاياوحكمك والنشيطة والفضولفأنزل الله تعالى هذه الآية .قوله تعالى : واتقوا الله أي عذاب الله ، إنه شديد لمن عصاه . وقيل : اتقوا الله في أوامره ونواهيه فلا تضيعوها .إن الله شديد العقاب لمن خالف ما أمره به ."

Such are indeed the truthful.) meaning, `they are those who were truthful in statement and deed, and they are the chiefs of the Muhajirin.' Allah the Exalted praised the Ansar next and emphasized their virtue, status and honor, preferring to give to others over themselves, even though they were in need, and not feeling enviousness. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ تَبَوَّءُوا الدَّارَ وَالإِيمَـنَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ</p><p>(And (it is also for) those who, before them, had homes and had adopted the faith,) referring to those who resided in the city to which the migration occurred, before the emigrants arrived at it, and who embraced the faith before many of the emigrants. `Umar said, \"I recommend the Khalifah, who will come after me, to know the rights and virtues of the foremost Muhajirin and to preserve their honor. I also recommend him to be kind to the Ansar, those who resided in the city of Hijrah and embraced the faith beforehand, that he accepts the good that comes from those who do good among them and forgives those among them who commit errors.\" Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>يُحِبُّونَ مَنْ هَاجَرَ إِلَيْهِمْ</p><p>(love those who emigrate to them,) indicates that they, on account of their generosity and honorable conduct, loved those who emigrated to them and comforted them with their wealth. Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said, \"The Muhajirin said, `O Allah's Messenger! We have never met people like those whom we emigrated to; comforting us in times of scarcity and giving us with a good heart in times of abundance. They have sufficed for us and shared their wealth with us so much so, that we feared that they might earn the whole reward instead of us.' He said,</p><p>«لَا، مَا أَثْنَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَدَعَوْتُمُ اللهَ لَهُم»</p><p>(No they won't, as long you thanked them for what they did and invoked Allah for them.)\" I have not seen this version in the other books. Al-Bukhari recorded that Yahya bin Sa`id heard Anas bin Malik, when he went with him to Al-Walid, saying, \"The Prophet called Ansar to divide Al-Bahrayn among them. The Ansar said, `Not until you give a similar portion to our emigrant brothers.' He said,</p><p>«إِمَّا لَا، فَاصْبِرُوا حَتْى تَلْقَوْنِي، فَإِنَّهُ سَيُصِيبُكُمْ بَعْدِي أَثَرَة»</p><p>(Perhaps, no; but you will soon see people giving preference to others, so remain patient until you meet me (on the Day of Resurrection).)\" Al-Bukhari was alone with this version. He also recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Ansar said (to the Prophet ), `Distribute our date-palms between us and our emigrant brothers.' He replied, `No.' The Ansar said (to the emigrants), `Look tend to the trees and share the fruits with us.' The emigrants said, `We hear and obey.\"' Al-Bukhari, but not Muslim, recorded it.</p><h2>The Ansar never envied the Muhajirin</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ يَجِدُونَ فِى صُدُورِهِمْ حَاجَةً مِّمَّآ أُوتُواْ</p><p>(and have no jealousy in their breasts for that which they have been given,) meaning, the Ansar did not have any envy for the Muhajirin because of the better status, rank, or more exalted grade that Allah gave the Muhajirin above them. Allah's statement,</p><p>مِّمَّآ أُوتُواْ</p><p>(that which they have been given,) refers to what the Muhajirin were favored with, according to Qatadah and Ibn Zayd.</p><h2>Selflessness of the Ansar</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَيُؤْثِرُونَ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ وَلَوْ كَانَ بِهِمْ خَصَاصَةٌ</p><p>(and give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that.) meaning, they preferred giving to the needy rather than attending to their own needs, and began by giving the people before their own selves, even though they too were in need. An authentic Hadith stated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَفْضَلُ الصَّدَقَةِ جُهْدُ الْمُقِل»</p><p>(The best charity is that given when one is in need and struggling.) This exalted rank is better than the rank of those whom Allah described in His statements,</p><p>وَيُطْعِمُونَ الطَّعَامَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ</p><p>(And they give food, inspite of their love for it.)(76:8), and,</p><p>وَءَاتَى الْمَالَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ</p><p>(And gives his wealth, in spite of love for it.)(2:177) The latter give charity even though they love the wealth they give, not that they really need it, nor that it is necessary for them to keep it. The former prefer others to themselves even though they are in need and have a necessity for what they spend in charity. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq gave away all his wealth in charity and Allah's Messenger ﷺ asked him,</p><p>«مَا أَبْقَيْتَ لِأَهْلِكَ؟»</p><p>(What did you keep for your family,) and he said, \"I kept for them Allah and His Messenger.\" `Ikrimah (bin Abi Jahl) and two other wounded fighters were offered water when they were injured during the battle of Al-Yarmuk, and each one of them said that the sip of water should be given to another of the three wounded men. They did so even though they were badly injured and craving water. When the water reached the third man, he and the other two died and none of them drank any of the water! May Allah be pleased with them and make them pleased with Him. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"A man came to the Prophet and said, `O Allah's Messenger! Poverty has stuck me.' The Prophet sent a messenger to his wives (to bring something for that man to eat) but they said that they had nothing. Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَلَا رَجُلٌ يُضَيِّفُ هَذَا، اللَّيْلَةَ، رَحِمَهُ الله»</p><p>(Who will invite this person or entertain him as a guest tonight; may Allah grant His mercy to him who does so) An Ansari man said, `I, O Allah's Messenger!' So he took him to his wife and said to her, `Entertain the guest of Allah's Messenger ﷺ generously.' She said, `By Allah ! We have nothing except the meal for my children.' He said, `Let your children sleep if they ask for supper. Then turn off the lamp and we go to bed tonight while hungry.' She did what he asked her to do. In the morning the Ansari went to Allah's Messenger ﷺ who said,</p><p>«لَقَدْ عَجِبَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَوْ ضَحِكَ مِنْ فُلَانٍ وَفُلَانَة»</p><p>(Allah wondered (favorably) or laughed at the action of so-and-so and his wife.) Then Allah revealed,</p><p>وَيُؤْثِرُونَ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ وَلَوْ كَانَ بِهِمْ خَصَاصَةٌ</p><p>(and they give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that). \" Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith in another part of his Sahih. Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith. In another narration for this Hadith, the Companion's name was mentioined, it was Abu Talhah Al-Ansari, may Allah be pleased with him. Allah said,</p><p>وَمَن يُوقَ شُحَّ نَفْسِهِ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</p><p>(And whosoever is saved from his own greed, such are they who will be the successful.) indicating that those who are saved from being stingy, then they have earned success and a good achievement. Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظُّلْمَ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، وَاتَّقُوا الشُّحَّ، فَإِنَّ الشُّحَّ أَهْلَكَ مَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمْ، حَمَلَهُمْ عَلى أَنْ سَفَكُوا دِمَاءَهُمْ وَاسْتَحَلُّوا مَحَارِمَهُم»</p><p>(Be on your guard against committing oppression, for oppression is a darkness on the Day of Resurrection. Be on your guard against being stingy, for being stingy is what destroyed those who were before you. It made them shed blood and make lawful what was unlawful for them.) Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Al-Aswad bin Hilal said that a man said to `Abdullah (bin Mas`ud),\"O Abu `Abdur-Rahman! I fear that I have earned destruction for myself.\" `Abdullah asked him what the matter was and he said, \"I hear Allah's saying,</p><p>وَمَن يُوقَ شُحَّ نَفْسِهِ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</p><p>(And whosoever is saved from his own greed, such are they who will be the successful.) and I am somewhat a miser who barely gives away anything.\" `Abdullah said, \"That is not the greed Allah mentioned in the Qur'an, which pertains to illegally consuming your brother's wealth. What you have is miserliness, and it is an evil thing indeed to be a miser.\" Allah said,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ جَآءُوا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لَنَا وَلإِخْوَنِنَا الَّذِينَ سَبَقُونَا بِالإَيمَـنِ وَلاَ تَجْعَلْ فِى قُلُوبِنَا غِلاًّ لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(And those who came after them say: \"Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.) This is the third type of believers whose poor most deserve to receive a part of the Fai'. These three types are the Muhajirin, the Ansar and those who followed their righteous lead with excellence. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَالسَّـبِقُونَ الاٌّوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَـجِرِينَ وَالأَنْصَـرِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ رَّضِىَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُواْ عَنْهُ</p><p>(And of the foremost to embrace Islam of the Muhajirin and the Ansar and also those who followed them exactly, Allah is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him.)(9:100) The third type are those who followed the Muhajirin and Ansar in their good works, beautiful attributes and who invoke Allah for them in public and secret. This is why Allah the Exalted said in this honorable Ayah,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ جَآءُوا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ يَقُولُونَ</p><p>(And those who came after them say), meaning, the statement that they utter is,</p><p>رَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لَنَا وَلإِخْوَنِنَا الَّذِينَ سَبَقُونَا بِالإَيمَـنِ وَلاَ تَجْعَلْ فِى قُلُوبِنَا غِلاًّ</p><p>(Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred), meaning, rage or envy,</p><p>لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.) Indeed, it is a beautiful way that Imam Malik used this honorable Ayah to declare that the Rafidah who curse the Companions do not have a share in the Fai' money, because they do not have the good quality of those whom Allah has described here that they say,</p><p>رَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لَنَا وَلإِخْوَنِنَا الَّذِينَ سَبَقُونَا بِالإَيمَـنِ وَلاَ تَجْعَلْ فِى قُلُوبِنَا غِلاًّ لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `A'ishah said, \"They were commanded to invoke Allah to forgive them, but instead, they cursed them!\" She then recited this Ayah,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ جَآءُوا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لَنَا وَلإِخْوَنِنَا الَّذِينَ سَبَقُونَا بِالإَيمَـنِ</p><p>(And those who came after them say: \"Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed.\")</p>"

আজ আমার মধ্যে ও আমার পিতার মধ্যে কিছু বচসা হয়েছে। তাই আমি শপথ করে বসেছি যে, তিন দিন পর্যন্ত আমি বাড়ীতে প্রবেশ করবে না। সুতরাং যদি দয়া করে আপনি আমাকে অনুমতি দেন তবে এই দিনগুলো আমি আপনার বাড়ীতে কাটিয়ে দিবো।” তিনি বললেনঃ “বেশ, ঠিক আছে।” অতএব, তিন দিন আমি তার সাথে তার বাড়ীতে অতিবাহিত করলাম। দেখলাম যে, তিনি রাত্রে তাহাজ্জুদের নামাযও পড়লেন না। শুধু এতোটুকু করলেন যে, জেগে ওঠে বিছানায় শুয়ে শুয়েই আল্লাহর যিক্র ও তাঁর শ্রেষ্ঠত্ব বর্ণনা করতে থাকলেন। হ্যাঁ, তবে এটা অবশ্যই ছিল যে, আমি তার মুখে ভাল কথা ছাড়া আর কিছুই শুনিনি। তিন রাত্রি অতিবাহিত হলে তাঁর আমল আমার কাছে হাল্কা লাগলো। অতঃপর আমি তাকে বললামঃ জনাব! আমার মধ্যে ও আমার পিতার মধ্যে কোন বচসাও হয়নি এবং অসন্তুষ্টির কারণে আমি বাড়িও ছাড়িনি। বরং প্রকৃত ব্যাপার এই যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) উপর্যুপরি তিন দিন বলেন যে, এখনই একটি জান্নাতী লোক আসবে। আর তিন দিনই আপনারই আগমন ঘটে। তাই আমি ইচ্ছা করলাম যে, কয়েকদিন আপনার সাহচর্যে আমি কাটিয়ে দিবে। অতঃপর এটা লক্ষ্য করবে যে, আপনি কি এমন আমল করেন যার কারণে রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) জীবিতাবস্থাতেই আপনার জান্নাতী হওয়ার সুসংবাদ আমাদেরকে প্রদান করলেন! তাই আমি এই কৌশল অবলম্বন করেছিলাম এবং তিন দিন পর্যন্ত আপনার খিদমতে থাকলাম, যেন আপনার আমল দেখে আমিও ঐরূপ আমল করে জান্নাতবাসী হতে পারি। কিন্তু আমি তো আপনাকে কোন নতুন ও গুরুত্বপূর্ণ আমল করতে দেখলাম না এবং ইবাদতেও তো অন্যদেরকে ছাড়িয়ে যেতে দেখলাম না। এখন আমি আপনার নিকট হতে বিদায় গ্রহণ করছি। কিন্তু বিদায় বেলায় আপনার নিকট আমি জানতে চাই যে, আর কি এমন আমল করেন যার কারণে স্বয়ং রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) আপনার জান্নাতী হওয়ার কথা বললেন? উত্তরে তিনি আমাকে বললেনঃ “তুমি আমাকে যে আমল করতে দেখেছো, এ ছাড়া অন্য কোন বিশেষ ও গোপনীয় আমল আমি করি না।” তাঁর এ জবাব শুনে আমি তাঁর নিকট হতে বিদায় গ্রহণ করে চলতে শুরু করলাম। অল্প দূরে গিয়েছি ইতিমধ্যে তিনি আমাকে ডাক দিয়ে বললেনঃ “আমার আর একটি আমল রয়েছে, তা এই যে, আমি কখনো কোন মুসলমানের প্রতি হিংসা ও শত্রুতা পোষণ করিনি এবং কখনো কোন মুসলমানের অমঙ্গল কামনা করিনি। আমি তার এ কথা শুনে বললামঃ হ্যাঁ, এবার আমার জানা হয়ে গেছে যে, আপনার এই আমলই আপনাকে এই মর্যাদায় পৌছিয়ে দিয়েছে এবং এটা এমনই এক আমল যে, অনেকেই এটার ক্ষমতা রাখে না।” (এ হাদীসটি মুসনাদে আহমাদে বর্ণিত হয়েছে। ইমাম নাসাঈও (রঃ) তাঁর নামক গ্রন্থে এ হাদীসটি আনয়ন করেছেন)মোটকথা, আনসারদের মধ্যে এই বিশেষণ ছিল যে, মুহাজিরগণ মাল ইত্যাদি লাভ করলে এবং তারা তা না পেলে তাঁরা মনক্ষুন্ন হতেন না। বানী নাযীর গোত্রের মাল মুহাজিরদের মধ্যে বন্টিত হলে কোন একজন আনসারী সমালোচনা করেন। ঐ সময় (আরবী) -এ আয়াতটি অবতীর্ণ হয়। রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) আনসারদেরকে বলেনঃ “তোমাদের মুহাজির ভাইগণ ধন-দৌলত ও সন্তান-সন্ততি ছেড়ে তোমাদের কাছে এসেছে।” তাঁরা তখন বলেনঃ “হে আল্লাহর রাসূল (সঃ)! আমাদের মাল-ধন আপনি তাদের মধ্যে ও আমাদের মধ্যে বন্টন করে দিন!” তিনি উত্তরে বললেনঃ “তোমরা কি এর চেয়েও বেশী ত্যাগ স্বীকার করতে পার না?” তারা জবাব দিলেনঃ “হে আল্লাহর রাসূল (সঃ)! বলুন, কি ত্যাগ স্বীকার আমাদেরকে করতে হবে?” তিনি বললেনঃ “মুহাজিরগণ ক্ষেত-খামারের কাজ জানে না। সুতরাং তোমরাই তোমাদের ক্ষেতে ও বাগানে কাজ করবে এবং উৎপাদিত ফল-শস্যাদি হতে তাদেরকে অংশ দিবে।” আনসারগণ সন্তুষ্ট চিত্তে এতে সম্মতি জানালেন। এরপর মহামহিমান্বিত আল্লাহ বলেনঃ তারা (আনসাররা) তাদেরকে (মুহাজিরদেরকে) নিজেদের উপর প্রাধান্য দেয় নিজেরা অভাগ্রস্ত হলেও।সহীহ্ হাদীসেও রয়েছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “যার কাছে (মালের) স্বল্পতা রয়েছে এবং নিজেরই প্রয়োজন আছে, এতদ্সত্ত্বেও সাদকা করে, তার সাদকা হলো উত্তম সাদকা।” এই মর্যাদা ঐ লোকদের মর্যাদার চেয়েও অগ্রগণ্য যাদের সম্পর্কে অল্লিাহ তা'আলা বলেনঃ (আরবী) অর্থাৎ “আহার্যের প্রতি আসক্তি সত্ত্বেও তারা অভাবগ্রস্ত, ইয়াতীম এবং বন্দীকে খাদ্য ভক্ষণ করিয়ে থাকে।” (৭৬:৮) আর এক জায়গায় আছেঃ (আরবী) অর্থাৎ \"মালের প্রতি আসক্তি সত্ত্বেও তারা তা দান করে। কিন্তু এই লোকগুলো অর্থাৎ আনসারদের নিজেদের প্রয়োজন ও অভাব থাকা সত্ত্বেও তারা দান করে থাকেন। মালের প্রতি আসক্তি থাকে এবং প্রয়োজন থাকে না ঐ সময়ের দান-খয়রাত ঐ মর্যাদায় পৌছে না যে, প্রয়োজন ও অভাব থাকা সত্ত্বেও দান করা হয়।এই প্রকারের দান ছিল হযরত আবু বকর সিদ্দীক (রাঃ)-এর দান। তিনি তার সমস্ত মাল নিয়ে রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ)-এর দরবারে হাযির হন। রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) তাকে জিজ্ঞেস করেনঃ “হে আবু বকর (রাঃ)! তোমার পরিবারবর্গের জন্যে কি রেখে এসেছো?” উত্তরে তিনি বলেনঃ “তাদের জন্যে আল্লাহ্ ও তাঁর রাসূল (সঃ)-কে রেখে এসেছি।” অনুরূপভাবে ঐ ঘটনাটিও এরই অন্তর্ভুক্ত যা ইয়ারমূকের যুদ্ধে হযরত ইকরামা (রাঃ) এবং তাঁর সঙ্গীদের ব্যাপারে ঘটেছিল। যুদ্ধের ময়দানে মুজাহিদগণ (রাঃ) আহত অবস্থায় পড়ে রয়েছেন। পিপাসায় কাতর হয়ে তাঁরা ছটফট করছেন এবং পানি পানি’ করে চীৎকার করছেন! এমন সময় একজন মুসলমান পানির মশক কাঁধে নিয়ে আসলেন। ঐ পানি তিনি আহত মুজাহিদদের সামনে পেশ করলেন। কিন্তু একজন বললেনঃ ঐ যে, ঐ ব্যক্তিকে দাও। তিনি ঐ দ্বিতীয় মুজাহিদের নিকট গেলেন। তিনি তখন তার পার্শ্ববর্তী আর এক ব্যক্তিকে দেখিয়ে দিলেন। ঐ মুসলমানটি তখন তৃতীয় মুজাহিদের নিকট গিয়ে দেখেন যে, তাঁর প্রাণরায়ু নির্গত হয়ে গেছে! দৌড়িয়ে তিনি দ্বিতীয় মুজাহিদের নিকট ফিরে গিয়ে দেখতে পান যে, তাঁরও প্রাণ পাখী। উড়ে গেছে। তারপর তিনি প্রথম মুজাহিদের নিকট ফিরে গিয়ে দেখেন যে, তিনিও এই নশ্বর জগত হতে বিদায় গ্রহণ করে মহান আল্লাহর কাছে হাযির হয়ে গেছেন! আল্লাহ্ তাঁদের প্রতি সন্তুষ্ট থাকুন ও তাদেরকে সন্তুষ্ট রাখুন!”  হযরত আবু হুরাইরা (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, একটি লোক রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-এর নিকট এসে বলেঃ “হে আল্লাহর রাসূল (সঃ)! আমি খুবই অভাবগ্রস্ত ব্যক্তি। মেহেরবানী করে আমার জন্যে কিছু খাবারের ব্যবস্থা করুন!” রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) তখন তাঁর স্ত্রীদের বাড়ীতে লোকে পাঠান। কিন্তু তাঁদের কারো বাড়ীতেই কিছুই পাওয়া গেল না। তিনি তখন জনগণকে লক্ষ্য করে বললেনঃ “রাত্রে আমার এই মেহমানকে নিয়ে যাবে এমন কেউ আছে কি?” একজন আনসারী (রাঃ) দাড়িয়ে গিয়ে বললেনঃ “হে আল্লাহর রাসূল (সঃ)! আমি (আছি)।” অতঃপর তিনি লোকটিকে সাথে নিয়ে বাড়ী চললেন। বাড়ী গিয়ে স্ত্রীকে বললেনঃ “দেখো, ইনি রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ)-এর মেহমান! আজ যদি আমরা নিজেরা কিছুই খেতে না পাই তবুও যেন এ মেহমান অনাহারে না থাকে।” এ কথা শুনে তাঁর স্ত্রী বললেনঃ “আল্লাহর কসম! বাড়ীতে আজ শিশুদের খাবার ছাড়া আর কিছুই নেই।” আনসারী তখন তাঁর স্ত্রীকে বললেনঃ “শিশুদের না খাইয়েই শুইয়ে দাও। আর আমরা দু'জন (স্বামী-স্ত্রী) তো পেটে কাপড় বেঁধে অনাহারেই রাত্রি কাটিয়ে দিবো। মেহমানের খাওয়ার সময় তুমি প্রদীপটি নিভিয়ে দিবে। তখন মেহমান। মনে করবে যে, আমরা খেতে আছি।” স্ত্রী তাই করলেন। সকালে লোকটি রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ)-এর দরবারে হাযির হলে তিনি বলেনঃ “মহামহিমান্বিত আল্লাহ্ এই ব্যক্তির এবং তার স্ত্রীর রাত্রের কাজ দেখে খুশী হয়েছেন এবং হেসেছেন।” ঐ ব্যাপারেই (আরবী)-এ আয়াতটি অবতীর্ণ হয়। (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম বুখারী (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন। সহীহ মুসলিমে ঐ আনসারীর নাম দেয়া হয়েছে হযরত আবূ তালহা (রাঃ)। ইমাম তিরমিযী (রঃ) এবং ইমাম নাসাঈও (রঃ) হাদীসটি বর্ণনা করেছেন)এরপর আল্লাহ তাবারাকা ওয়া তা'আলা বলেনঃ যারা কার্পণ্য হতে নিজেদেরকে মুক্ত করেছে তারাই সফলকাম।  হযরত জাবির ইবনে আবদিল্লাহ (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “হে জনমণ্ডলী! তোমরা যুলুম হতে বেঁচে থাকো। কেননা, এই যুলুম কিয়ামতের দিন যুলমত বা অন্ধকারের কারণ হবে। হে লোক সকল! তোমরা কার্পণ্য ও লোভ-লালসাকে ভয় কর। কেননা, এটা এমন একটা জিনিস যা ততামাদের পূর্ববর্তী লোকদেরকে ধ্বংস করে ফেলেছে। এরই কারণে তারা পরস্পর খুনাখুনি করেছে এবং হারামকে হালাল করে নিয়েছে।” (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম আহমাদ (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন। সহীহ মুসলিমেও এটা বর্ণিত হয়েছে)হযরত আবদুল্লাহ ইবনে আমর (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “তোমরা যুলম হতে দূরে থাকো। কেননা, যুলম কিয়ামতের দিন অন্ধকার রূপ ধারণ করবে। আর তোমরা কটুবাক্য প্রয়োগ করা হতে বিরত থাকো। জেনে রেখো যে, আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা অশ্লীলভাষীকে ও নির্লজ্জতাপূর্ণ। কাজকে ভালবাসেন না। তোমরা লোভ-লালসা ও কার্পণ্য হতে বিরত থাকো। কেননা, একারণেই তোমাদের পূর্ববর্তী লোকদেরকে ধ্বংস করে দেয়া হয়েছে। তারা জনগণকে যুলম করার নির্দেশ দিতো তখন তারা যুলম করতো, তারা পাপাচারের হুকুম করতো ফলে তারা পাপাচার করতো এবং তারা আত্মীয়তার সম্পর্ক ছিন্ন করার নির্দেশ দিতো, তাই তারা আত্মীয়তার সম্পর্ক ছিন্ন করতো।” (ইমাম আ’মাশ (রঃ) ও ইমাম শু'বা (রঃ) এটা বর্ণনা করেছেন)হযরত আবু হুরাইরা (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, তিনি রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-কে বলতে শুনেছেনঃ “আল্লাহর পথের ধুলো-বালি এবং জাহান্নামের ধূয়া কোন বান্দার পেটে একত্রিত হতে পারে না (অর্থাৎ আল্লাহর পথের ধুলো যার উপরে পড়েছে সে জাহান্নামের আগুন হতে মুক্ত হয়ে গেছে)।”(ইমাম আহমাদ (রঃ), ইমাম আবু দাঊদ (রঃ) এবং ইমাম নাসাঈ (রঃ) এ হাদীসটি বর্ণনা করেছেন)হযরত আসওয়াদ ইবনে হিলাল (রঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, একটি লোক হযরত আবদুল্লাহ্ (রাঃ)-এর নিকট এসে বলেঃ “হে আবু আবদির রহমান (রাঃ)! আমি তো ধ্বংস হয়ে গেছি।” তিনি তার একথা শুনে বলেনঃ “কেন, ব্যাপার কি?” লোকটি উত্তরে বলেঃ “যারা কার্পণ্য হতে নিজেদেরকে মুক্ত করেছে তারাই সফলকাম। আর আমি তো একজন কৃপণ লোক। আমি তো আমার মালের কিছুই খরচ করতে চাই না!” তখন হযরত আবদুল্লাহ্ (রাঃ) তাকে বললেনঃ “এখানে কার্পণ্য দ্বারা উদ্দেশ্য এই যে, তুমি তোমার কোন মুসলমান ভাই-এর মাল যুলম করে ভক্ষণ করবে। হ্যাঁ, তবে কার্পণ্যও নিঃসন্দেহে খুবই খারাপ জিনিস।” (এটা ইমাম ইবনে আবি হাতিম (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)হযরত আবুল হাইয়াজ আসাদী (রঃ) হতে বর্ণিত, তিনি বলেন, রায়তুল্লাহ্র তাওয়াফ করা অবস্থায় আমি দেখলাম যে, একটি লোক শুধু -এই দু'আটি পাঠ করছেন অর্থাৎ “হে আল্লাহ! আপনি আমাকে আমার জীবনের কার্পণ্য ও লোভ-লালসা হতে রক্ষা করুন!” শেষ পর্যন্ত আমি থাকতে না পেরে তাকে জিজ্ঞেস করলামঃ জনাব! আপনি শুধু এই প্রার্থনাই কেন করছেন? তিনি উত্তরে বললেনঃ “যদি এটা হতে রক্ষা পাওয়া যায় তবে ব্যভিচার হবে না, চুরি হবে না এবং অন্য কোন খারাপ কাজও হতে পারে না।” অতঃপর আমি তার দিকে ভাল করে চেয়ে দেখলাম। তখন দেখি যে, তিনি হলেন হযরত আবদুর রহমান ইবনে আউফ (রাঃ)।” (এটা হযরত সুফইয়ান সাওরী (রঃ) ও হযরত ইমাম ইবনে জারীর (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)হযরত আনাস ইবনে মালিক (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “যে ব্যক্তি যাকাত আদায় করলো, মেহমানদারী করলো এবং আল্লাহর পথের জরুরী কাজে (মাল) প্রদান করলো সে তার নফসের কার্পণ্য ও লোভ-লালসা হতে দূর হয়ে গেল।মহান আল্লাহ বলেনঃ যারা তাদের (মুহাজির ও আনসারদের) পরে এসেছে, তারা বলেঃ হে আমাদের প্রতিপালক! আমাদেরকে এবং ঈমানে অগ্রণী আমাদের ভ্রাতাগণকে ক্ষমা করুন এবং মুমিনদের বিরুদ্ধে আমাদের অন্তরে হিংসা-বিদ্বেষ রাখবেন না। হে আমাদের প্রতিপালক! আপনি তো দয়ার্দ্র, পরম দয়ালু। (এটাও ইমাম ইবনে জারীর (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)এঁরা হলেন ফায়-এর মালের তৃতীয় প্রকার হকদার। মুহাজির ও আনসারদের দরিদ্রদের পরে তাদের অনুসারী হলেন তাদের পরবর্তী লোকেরা। এই লোকদের মিসকীনরাও এই ফায়-এর মালের হকদার। এঁরা আল্লাহ্ তা'আলার নিকট এঁদের পূর্ববর্তী ঈমানদার লোকদের জন্যে ক্ষমা প্রার্থনা করে থাকেন। যেমন সূরায়ে বারাআতে রয়েছেঃ (আরবী) অর্থাৎ “মুহাজির ও আনসারদের মধ্যে যারা প্রথম অগ্রগামী এবং যারা নিষ্ঠার সাথে তাদের অনুসরণ করে আল্লাহ্ তাদের প্রতি প্রসন্ন এবং তারাও তাতে সন্তুষ্ট।” (৯:১০০) অর্থাৎ এই পরবর্তী লোকেরা ঐ পূর্ববর্তী লোকদের পদাংক অনুসরণকারী এবং তাদের উত্তম চরিত্রের অনুসারী ও ভাল দু'আর মাধ্যমে তাদেরকে স্মরণকারী। যেন তাদের ভিতর ও বাহির পূর্ববর্তীদের অনুসারী। এজন্যেই আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা এই আয়াতে কারীমায় বলেনঃ যারা তাদের পরে এসেছে তারা বলেঃ হে আমাদের প্রতিপালক! আমাদেরকে এবং ঈমানে অগ্রণী আমাদের ভ্রাতাদেরকে ক্ষমা করুন এবং মুমিনদের বিরুদ্ধে আমাদের অন্তরে হিংসা-বিদ্বেস রাখবেন না। হে আমাদের প্রতিপালক! আপনি তো দয়ার্দ্র, পরম দয়ালু।এই দু'আ দ্বারা হযরত ইমাম মালিক (রঃ) কতই না পবিত্র দলীল গ্রহণ করেছেন। তিনি বলেন যে, রাফেযী সম্প্রদায়ের কোন লোককে যেন সেই সময়ের নেতা ফায়-এর মাল হতে কিছুই প্রদান না করেন। কেননা, তারা রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ)-এর সাহাবীদের জন্যে দু'আ করার পরিবর্তে তাদেরকে গালি দিয়ে থাকে। হযরত আয়েশা সিদ্দীকা (রাঃ) বলেনঃ “ঐ লোকদের প্রতি তোমরা লক্ষ্য কর যে, কিভাবে তারা কুরআনের বিরুদ্ধাচরণ করছে! কুরআন হুকুম করছে যে, মানুষ যেন মুহাজির ও আনসারদের জন্যে দু'আ করে, অথচ এ লোকগুলো (রাফেযীরা) তাদেরকে গালি দেয়।” অতঃপর তিনি...(আরবী)-এ আয়াতটি পাঠ করেন। (এটা ইমাম ইবনে আবি হাতিম (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)হযরত মাসরূক (রঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, হযরত আয়েশা (রাঃ) বলেনঃ “রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ)-এর সাহাবীদের জন্যে ক্ষমা প্রার্থনা করার তোমাদেরকে নির্দেশ দেয়া হয়েছে, অথচ তোমরা তাদেরকে গালি দিচ্ছ! আমি তোমাদের নবী (সঃ)-কে বলতে শুনেছিঃ “এই উম্মত শেষ হবে না যে পর্যন্ত না তাদের পরবর্তীরা পূর্ববর্তীদেরকে লা'নত করবে।” (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম বাগাভী (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)হযরত উমার (রাঃ) বলেন যে, (আরবী)-এই আয়াতে যে ফায়-এর মালের বর্ণনা দেয়া হয়েছে ওটা তো রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ)-এর জন্যে খাস। তারপর পরবর্তী (আরবী)-এই আয়াতে যে মালের কথা বলা হয়েছে তা আম বা সাধারণ করে দেয়া হয়েছে এবং সমস্ত মুসলমান এর অন্তর্ভুক্ত রয়েছে। এখন একজন মুসলমানও এমন নেই যার এই মালের অধিকার নেই, শুধু গোলামদের ছাড়া। (এটা ইমাম আবু দাউদ (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন। কিন্তু এ হাদীসের সনদটি ছেদকাটা)হযরত মালিক ইবনে আউস ইবনে হাসান (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, হযরত উমার ইবনে খাত্তাব (রাঃ) (আরবী) (৯:৬০)-এই আয়াতটি পাঠ করে বলেনঃ “যাকাতের হকদার তো হলো এই লোকগুলো।” তারপর তিনি (আরবী) (৮:৪১) -এ আয়াতটি পাঠ করেন। অতঃপর বলেনঃ “গানীমাতের হকদার তো হলো এই লোকগুলো।” এরপর তিনি (আরবী) এ আয়াতগুলো পাঠ করে বলেনঃ “ফায়-এর মালের হকদারদের বর্ণনা দেয়ার পর এই আয়াত সমস্ত মুসলমানকে এই ফায়-এর মালের হকদার বানিয়ে দিয়েছে। সবাই এই মালের হকদার। যদি আমি জীবিত থাকি তবে তোমরা দেখবে যে, গ্রাম-পল্লীর রাখালদেরকেও আমি এর অংশ প্রদান করবে যাদের কপালে এই মাল লাভ করার জন্যে ঘর্মও দেখা দেয়নি।” (এটা ইমাম ইবনে জারীর (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)</p>"

They are the truthful.... 59:8)</p><p>This verse describes all the characteristics of the emigrants. The first of them is that they were driven from their homes and wealth, that is to say, their only crime was that they had embraced Islam and supported the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ، as a result of which the pagans of Makkah persecuted them, so much so that they had to abandon their hearths and homes and emigrate to Madinah. Some of them had to tie stones to their stomach on account of unbearable hunger, and others used to protect themselves against cold by digging holes in the ground, because they did not have clothes to save them from the chill of winter. [ Mazhari, Qurtubi ]</p><p>An Important Issue: The rule about the control of unbelievers over the wealth and property of the Muslims</p><p>This verse describes the emigrants as poor, whereas a faqir [ poor ] in Islamic law refers to a person who has no property whatever, or a person who possesses a little property, but is poor because he does not possess the minimum amount of property constituting nisab of Zakah. However, most of the emigrants were rich, wealthy and affluent while they were in Makkah. Even after migration, if the wealth had remained in their ownership, it would be inappropriate to refer to them as 'poor' because they had nisab of Zakah. But the Qur'an refers to them as 'poor' and thus points out that the wealth and property which they had left behind in Makkah, and the pagans subsequently took possession of them, became the property of the pagans and the Muslims lost its ownership.</p><p>Therefore, Imams Abu Hanifah and Malik رحمۃ اللہ علیہما ruled that if Muslims abandon their homes and possessions and migrate to some other land, and the non-believers take control of their abandoned homes and property, the ownership passes into their hands and Muslims lose ownership. Similarly, if - God forbid! - the unbelievers conquer an Islamic country, usurping Muslim property and wealth, then after having full control over it, they are deemed as owners of that property. Consequently, their transactions of sale and purchase of such properties are recognized in Shari` ah. Mazhari has, on this occasion in his commentary, cited all the relevant Traditions supporting this view.</p><p>The second characteristic of the emigrants is described thus: يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِّنَ اللَّـهِ وَرِ‌ضْوَانًا (...seeking the grace of Allah and [ His ] pleasure...59:8). When they embraced Islam, abandoned their country and wealth and migrated, they did not have any ulterior motive. They did all this only to seek Divine favour and gain His good pleasure. This indicates their perfect sincerity. The word fadl [ bounty, grace ] is normally used for worldly blessings and ridwan [ good pleasure ] for blessings of the Hereafter. From this viewpoint, the verse purports to describe that the emigrants gave up all their previous means of luxury, such as their hearths and homes, and now they were in quest of their worldly needs and the blessings of the Hereafter in the shade of Islam. Their objective was to seek the necessities of worldly life under the banner of Allah's and His Messenger's efficacious grace.</p><p>The third characteristic of the emigrants is described thus: وَيَنصُرُ‌ونَ اللَّـهَ وَرَ‌سُولَهُ (...and were helping Allah and His Messenger...59:8). The phrase 'help Allah' means to help His religion, for which they made tremendous and amazing self-sacrifices.</p><p>The fourth characteristic of the emigrants is described thus: أُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ الصَّادِقُونَ (... They are the truthful...59:8). That is, such people are sincerely true in words and deeds. The covenant they made with Allah and His Messenger by reciting the kalimah, they duly fulfilled it and proved themselves to be true about it. This verse candidly testifies to the truthfulness of all emigrant Companions. Anyone calling any of them a 'liar' cannot be a Muslim, because he is rejecting this verse. God forbid! Rawafid call these Companions 'hypocrites'. This is a clear rejection of the verse. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ held the emigrant Companions ؓ in such high esteem that when he prayed to Allah, he would supplicate through their wasilah. [ as transmitted by Al-Baghawi and Mazhari ].</p>"

آمد سے پہلے“ یہ انصارِ مدینہ کا ذکر ہے کہ مہاجرین کی آمد پر ان کا طرزعمل کیا تھا :  { یُحِبُّوْنَ مَنْ ہَاجَرَ اِلَـیْہِمْ } ”وہ محبت کرتے ہیں ان سے جنہوں نے ہجرت کی ان کی طرف“ مدینہ منورہ کے مسلمانوں نے مکہ مکرمہ سے آنے والے مہاجرین کو کھلے دل سے خوش آمدید کہا۔ ان میں سے کسی کے دل میں قطعاً کوئی ایسا خیال نہیں آیا کہ ان لوگوں کے آنے سے ہماری آبادی بڑھ جائے گی اور ان کی ناداری و محرومی ہماری معیشت پر بوجھ بن جائے گی۔ { وَلَا یَجِدُوْنَ فِیْ صُدُوْرِہِمْ حَاجَۃً مِّمَّـآ اُوْتُوْا } ”اور وہ نہیں پاتے اپنے سینوں میں کوئی حاجت اس بارے میں کہ جو کچھ ان مہاجرین کو دیا جاتا ہے“ انصارِ مدینہ کے دل اپنے مہاجر بھائیوں کے لیے ایثار و قربانی کے اعلیٰ جذبات سے لبریز ہیں ‘ اور یہ جذبات ان کے دلوں میں اس دولت ایمان کے باعث پیدا ہوئے ہیں جس سے اللہ تعالیٰ نے انہیں بہرہ ور فرمایا ہے۔ یہ آیت دراصل انصارِ مدینہ کی تسکین وتشفی کے لیے ان کے جذبہ ایمان کو اپیل کرتے ہوئے نازل ہوئی تاکہ اگر ان میں سے کچھ لوگوں کے دلوں میں بنونضیر کے چھوڑے ہوئے مال سے متوقع حصہ نہ ملنے کے باعث کچھ ملال وغیرہ کے احساسات پیدا ہوئے ہوں تو وہ ختم ہوجائیں۔ { وَیُـؤْثِرُوْنَ عَلٰٓی اَنْفُسِہِمْ وَلَـوْ کَانَ بِہِمْ خَصَاصَۃٌط } ”اور وہ تو خود پر ترجیح دیتے ہیں دوسروں کو خواہ ان کے اپنے اوپر تنگی ہو۔“ ایثار کے معنی کسی کے لیے قربانی دینے اور دوسروں کو اپنے اوپر ترجیح دینے کے ہیں۔ ظاہر ہے انصارِ مدینہ میں سے بھی سب لوگ دولت مند تو نہیں تھے ‘ ان میں بھی بہت سے لوگ نادار اور تنگ دست تھے ‘ لیکن ان میں سے ہر ایک نے اپنی احتیاج اور ضرورت کو پس پشت ڈال کر استطاعت بھر اپنے مہاجر بھائیوں کی مدد کی تھی۔ ان کے اسی جذبہ ایثار کا اعتراف یہاں اس آیت میں کیا گیا ہے۔ { وَمَنْ یُّـوْقَ شُحَّ نَفْسِہٖ فَاُولٰٓئِکَ ہُمُ الْمُفْلِحُوْنَ۔ } ”اور جو کوئی بھی بچالیا گیا اپنے جی کے لالچ سے تو وہی لوگ ہیں فلاح پانے والے۔“ اب اس کے بعد جو آیت آرہی ہے وہ اس لحاظ سے بہت اہم ہے کہ حضرت عمر فاروق رض نے ایران ‘ عراق ‘ مصر ‘ شام وغیرہ کے مفتوحہ علاقوں کی زمینوں کے بارے میں فیصلہ کرتے ہوئے اس آیت سے استدلال کیا تھا۔ ان علاقوں کی زمینیں بہت زرخیز ہیں ‘ خصوصی طور پر عراق اور شام کے درمیان صحرا میں واقع وہ علاقہ جو Fertile Crescent کہلاتا ہے ‘ اپنی زرخیزی کے اعتبار سے پوری دنیا میں مشہور ہے۔ جب یہ وسیع و عریض علاقے فتح ہوئے تو ان کی زرعی زمینوں کے نظم و نسق کا مسئلہ سامنے آیا۔ اس معاملے میں زیادہ تر صحابہ رض کی رائے یہ تھی کہ مال غنیمت کی تقسیم کے اصول کے مطابق پانچواں حصہ بیت المال کے لیے مختص کر کے باقی زمینیں ہر محاذ کے مجاہدین میں تقسیم کردی جائیں۔ البتہ حضرت عمر رض اس رائے سے متفق نہیں تھے۔ آپ کی رائے یہ تھی کہ ان ممالک کی زمینیں مال غنیمت کے بجائے مالِ فے کے زمرے میں آتی ہیں ‘ اس لیے ان پر مال فے کے قانون کا اطلاق ہونا چاہیے۔ اس نکتے کی مزید وضاحت یہ ہے کہ مال غنیمت صرف وہ مال ہے جو جنگ میں دشمن کو شکست دینے کے بعد عین محاذ جنگ سے مسلمان مجاہدین کے ہاتھ لگے۔ جیسے اسلحہ ‘ راشن ‘ بھیڑ بکریاں ‘ اونٹ گھوڑے ‘ جنگی قیدی وغیرہ۔ لیکن اگر کسی ایک جنگ کے نتیجے میں کوئی پورا ملک فتح ہوجائے جیسے ابراہیم لودھی پانی پت کے میدان میں بابر سے صرف ایک جنگ ہارا تو اس کے نتیجے میں پورے ہندوستان پر بابر کا قبضہ ہوگیا تو میدانِ جنگ سے باہر کی اراضی ‘ املاک اور آبادی کو مال فے شمار کیا جائے گا۔ حضرت عمر رض نے اس معاملے میں اگلی آیت کے ان الفاظ سے استدلال کیا تھا : { وَالَّذِیْنَ جَآئُ وْ مِنْم بَعْدِہِمْ } ”اور وہ لوگ جو ان کے بعد آئیں گے“۔ پچھلی آیات کے مضمون سے اس آیت کے ان الفاظ کا ربط یوں بنتا ہے کہ مال فے پر حق ہے اللہ و رسول ﷺ کا ‘ رسول اللہ ﷺ کے عزیز و اقارب کا ‘ غرباء و مساکین کا ‘ انصار و مہاجرین کا بحوالہ آیات 7 اور 8 اور ان لوگوں کا جو ان کے بعد آئیں گے۔ ان آیات کے سیاق وسباق میں حضرت عمر رض کا موقف یہ تھا کہ آج کے مال فے میں اس امت کے قیامت تک آنے والے مسلمانوں کا بھی حق ہے اور اگر آج یہ زمینیں چندہزار مجاہدین میں تقسیم کردی گئیں تو بعد میں آنے والے مسلمان گویا اس حق سے محروم رہ جائیں گے۔ حضرت عمر رض کے اس استدلال سے بعض معتبر صحابہ رض نے اختلاف بھی کیا اور مذکورہ زمینوں کو مال غنیمت کے قانون کے تحت متعلقہ مجاہدین میں تقسیم کرنے پر اصرار کیا۔ اس اختلافِ رائے کے بعد حضرت عمر رض نے اس معاملے میں غور و خوض کے لیے اوس ‘ خزرج اور مہاجرین میں سے چند صحابہ رض پر مشتمل ایک کمیشن تشکیل دے دیا۔ کمیشن کے ارکان نے مسئلے سے متعلق مختلف آراء اور دیگر پہلوئوں کو مدنظر رکھتے ہوئے متفقہ طور پر جو فیصلہ دیا وہ حضرت عمر رض کی رائے کے عین مطابق تھا اور بعد میں اسی فیصلے پر تمام صحابہ رض کا اجماع ہوا۔ صحابہ رض کے اس اجماع یا فیصلے کے مطابق تمام مسلم ممالک کی اراضی دو اقسام میں بٹ گئی۔ جن علاقوں کے لوگ لڑے بھڑے بغیر ایمان لے آئے ان کی زمینیں ”عشری زمینیں“ ایسی زمین جو انفرادی ملکیت میں ہو اور اس کی پیداوار سے باقاعدہ ُ عشر وصول کیا جاتا ہو قرار پائیں۔ جبکہ بزور شمشیر فتح ہونے والے ممالک کی زمینوں کو ”خراجی زمینوں“ ایسی زمینیں جو بیت المال کی ملکیت ہوں اور ان کو کاشت کرنے والے لوگ اسلامی حکومت کو خراج ادا کریں کا درجہ دیا گیا۔ مثلاً مدینہ کو حضور ﷺ نے کسی جنگ کے نتیجے میں فتح نہیں کیا تھا بلکہ مدینہ کے لوگوں نے حضور ﷺ کو وہاں آنے کی خود دعوت دی تھی ‘ اس لیے اوس اور خزرج کی تمام زمینیں ”عشری“ قرار پائیں اور متعلقہ لوگوں کی انفرادی ملکیت میں ہی رہیں ‘ جبکہ ایران ‘ عراق ‘ مصر ‘ شام وغیرہ ممالک کی زمینیں خراجی زمینوں کی حیثیت سے اسلامی حکومت کی تحویل میں چلی گئیں۔ اس طرح حضرت عمر رض کے اجتہاد کے نتیجے میں انسانی تاریخ میں پہلی مرتبہ زمین کی اجتماعی ملکیت collective ownership of land کا نظام متعارف ہوا۔ اس وقت مفتوحہ علاقوں کی زمینیں اگر مال غنیمت کی حیثیت سے چند ہزار مجاہدین میں تقسیم کردی جاتیں تو اسلامی حکومت کے تحت انسانی تاریخ کی سب سے بڑی جاگیرداری وجود میں آجاتی۔ اور پھر یہ سلسلہ یہیں پر ختم نہ ہوتا بلکہ جس ملک کی اراضی و املاک پر مال غنیمت کے قانون کا اطلاق ہوتا اس ملک کی پوری آبادی کو جنگی قیدیوں کی حیثیت سے غلام اور لونڈیاں بنا کر تقسیم کرنے کا مطالبہ بھی آتا۔ اسی قانون کے تحت پچھلی صدی تک ہندوستان کی زمینوں کے بارے میں بھی یہاں کے علماء کا اجماع تھا کہ یہاں کی تمام زمینیں خراجی ہیں اور اس حیثیت سے یہ زمینیں یہاں کے مسلمانوں کی اجتماعی ملکیت ہیں اور یہ کہ ہندوستان میں کوئی عشری زمین نہیں ہے۔ اس کا ذکر ہندوستان کے عظیم مفسر و محدث قاضی ثناء اللہ پانی پتی رح نے فقہ کے مسائل سے متعلق اپنے رسالے ”مَالاَ بُدَّ مِنْہ“ میں بھی کیا ہے۔ قاضی صاحب موصوف بہت بڑے صوفی اور مفتی بھی تھے۔ ان کی لکھی ہوئی ”تفسیر مظہری“ جسے انہوں نے اپنے مرشد مرزا مظہر جانِ جاناں رح کے نام سے منسوب کیا ہے ‘ آج کسی تعارف کی محتاج نہیں ہے۔ قاضی صاحب کا مرتب کردہ مذکورہ رسالہ فقہ کے بنیادی اور ابتدائی مسائل پر مشتمل ہے اور برصغیر کے تمام عربی مدارس میں پڑھایا جاتا ہے۔ اس رسالے میں انہوں نے عشر سے متعلق مسائل شامل ہی نہیں کیے اور اس کی وجہ یہ لکھی ہے کہ جب ہندوستان میں کوئی عشری زمین ہے ہی نہیں اور عشر سے متعلق احکام کی تنفیذ و تعمیل کا کوئی امکان ہی نہیں تو ان مسائل کو لکھنے ‘ پڑھنے یا سمجھنے کی بھی کوئی ضرورت نہیں۔ اس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ اس علاقے میں جب کبھی اسلامی حکومت قائم ہو تو نئے بندوبست اراضی کے تحت بڑے بڑے جاگیرداروں سے وہ زمینیں واپس لی جاسکتی ہیں جو ماضی کے بادشاہوں ‘ انگریز حکمرانوں اور سپہ سالاروں کی ”نظر کرم“ کے باعث انہیں عطا ہوئی تھیں۔</p>"

أَنْفُسِهِمْ وَلَوْ كَانَ بِهِمْ خَصَاصَةٌ وَمَنْ يُوقَ شُحَّ نَفْسِهِ فَأُولَئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ (9)الأظهر أن { الذين } عطف على { المهاجرين } [ الحشر : 8 ] أي والذين تبوّؤا الدار . والذين تبوّؤا الدار هم الأنصار .والدّار تطلق على البلاد ، وأصلُها مَوضع القبيلة من الأرض . وأطلقت على القرية قال تعالى في ذكر ثمود { فأصبحوا في دَارهم جاثمين } [ الأعراف : 78 ] ، أي في مدينتهم وهي حجر ثمود .والتعريف هنا للعهد لأن المراد بالدار : يثرب ، والمعنى الذين هم أصحاب الدار . هذا توطئة لقوله : { يحبون من هاجر إليهم } .والتبوُّء : اتخاذ المباءة وهي البُقعة التي يَبوء إليها صاحبها ، أي يرجع إليها بعد انتشاره في أعماله . وفي موقع قوله : { والإيمان } غموض إذ لا يصح أن يكون مفعولاً لفعل تبوَّءوا ، فتأوله المفسرون على وجهين : أحدهما أن يجعل الكلام استعارة مكنية بتشبيه الإِيمان بالمَنْزل وجعْل إثبات التَّبَوُّءِ تخييلاً فيكون فعل تبوأوا مستعملاً في حقيقته ومجازه .وجمهور المفسرين جعلوا المعطوف عاملاً مقدراً يدلّ عليه الكلام ، تقديره : وأخلصوا الإِيمان على نحو قول الراجز الذي لا يعرف: ... علفتها تبناً وماءً بارداًوقول عبد الله بن الزِّبَعْرَى: ... يا ليت زوجَككِ قد غدامتقلداً سيفاً ورمحاً ... أي وممسكاً رمحاً وهو الذي درج عليه في «الكشاف» . وقيل الواو للمعية . و { الإِيمانَ } مفعول معه .وعندي أن هذا أحسن الوجوه ، وإن قلّ قائلوه . والجمهور يجعلون النصب على المفعول معه سماعياً فهو عندهم قليل الاستعمال فتجنبوا تخريج آيات القرآن عليه حتى ادعى ابن هشام في «مُغني اللبيب» أنه غير واقع في القرآن بيقين . وتأول قوله تعالى : { فأَجمِعُوا أمرَكم وشركاءَكم } [ يونس : 71 ] ، ذلك لأن جمهور البصريين يشترطون أن يكون العامل في المفعول معه هو العاملَ في الاسم الذي صاحَبَه ولا يرون واو المعية ناصبة المفعول معه خلافاً للكوفيين والأخفش فإن الواو عندهم بمعنى ( مع ) . وقال عبد القاهر : منصوب بالواو .والحق عدم التزام أن يكون المفعول معه معمولاً للفعل ، ألا ترى صحة قول القائل : استوى الماء والخشبةَ . وقولهم : سرْتُ والنيلَ ، وهو يفيد الثناء عليهم بأن دار الهجرة دارُهم آووا إليها المهاجرين لأنها دار مؤمنين لا يماثلها يومئذٍ غيرها .وبذلك يتضح أن متعلق { من قبلهم } فعل { تبوؤا } بمفرده ، وأن المجرور المتعلق به قيدٌ فِيه دون ما ذكر بعد الواو لأن الواو ليست واو عطف فلذلك لا تكون قائمة مقام الفعل السابق لأن واو المعية في معنى ظرف فلا يعلق بها مجرور .وفي ذكر الدار ( وهي المدينة ) مع ذكر الإِيمان إيماء إلى فضيلة المدينة بحيث جعل تبوّءهم المدينة قرين الثناء عليهم بالإِيمان ولعل هذا هو الذي عناه مالك رحمه الله فيما رواه عنه ابن وهب قال : سمعت مالكاً يذكر فضل المدينة على غيرها من الآفاق . فقال : إن المدينة تبوّئت بالإِيمان والهجرة وإن غيرها من القرى افتتحت بالسيف ثم قرأ : { والذين تبوؤا الدار والإيمان من قبلهم يحبون من هاجر إليهم } الآية .وجملة { يحبون من هاجر إليهم } حال من الذين تَبَوَّؤُوا الدار ، وهذا ثناء عليهم بما تقرر في نفوسهم من أخوة الإِسلام إذ أحبوا المهاجرين ، وشأن القبائل أن يتحرجوا من الذين يهاجرون إلى ديارهم لمضايقتهم .ومن آثار هذه المحبة ما ثبت في «الصحيح» من خبر سعد بن الربيع مع عبد الرحمان بن عوف إذ عرض سعد عليه أن يقاسمه ماله وأن يَنزل له عن إحدى زوجتيه ، وقد أسكنوا المهاجرين معهم في بيوتهم ومنحوهم من نخيلهم ، وحسبك الأخوة التي آخى النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم بين المهاجرين والأنصار .وقوله : { ولا يجدون في صدورهم حاجة مما أوتوا } أريد بالوجدان الإِدراك العقلي ، وكنى بانتفاء وجدان الحاجة عن انتفاء وجودها لأنها لو كانت موجودة لأدركوها في نفوسهم وهذا من باب قول الشاعر: ... ولا ترى الضبّ بها ينجحروالحاجة في الأصل : اسم مَصدرِ الحَوْج وهو الاحتياج ، أي الافتقار إلى شيء ، وتطلق على الأمر المحتاج إليه من إطلاق المصدر على اسم المفعول ، وهي هنا مجاز في المأْرب والمرادِ ، وإطلاق الحاجة إلى المأرب مجاز مشهور ساوى الحقيقة كقوله تعالى : { ولتبلغوا عليها حاجة في صدوركم } [ غافر : 80 ] ، أي لتبلغوا في السفر عليها المأْرب الذي تسافرون لأجله ، وكقوله تعالى : { إلا حاجة في نفس يعقوب قضاها } [ يوسف : 68 ] أي مأربا مُهمّا وقول النابغة: ... أيامَ تخبرني نُعْمٌ وأَخْبِرُهاما أكتُم الناسَ من حاجِي وإسراري ... وعليه فتكون ( مِن ) في قوله : { مما أوتوا } ابتدائية ، أي مأرباً أو رغبة ناشئة من فَيْء أُعْطِيهُ المهاجرون . والصدور مراد بها النفوس جمع الصدر وهو الباطن الذي فيه الحواس الباطنة وذلك كإطلاق القلب على ذلك .و ( ما أوتوا ) هو فيء بني النضير .وضمير { صدورهم } عائد إلى { الذين تَبَوَّؤُا الدار } ، وضمير { أوتوا } عائد إلى { من هاجر إليهم } ، لأن من هاجر جماعة من المهاجرين فروعي في ضمير معنى ( مَنْ ) بدون لفظها . وهذان الضميران وإن كانا ضميري غيبة وكانا مقتربَين فالسامع يرد كل ضمير إلى معاده بحسب السياق مثل ( ما ) في قوله تعالى : { وعمروها أكثر مما عمروها } في سورة [ الروم : 9 ] . وقول عباس بن مرداس يذكر انتصار المسلمين مع قومه بني سُليم على هَوازن :عُدنا ولولا نَحنُ أحدَق جمعهمبالمسلمين وأحرزوا ما جمَّعوا( أي أحرز جيش هوازن ما جمّعه جيش المسلمين ) .والمعنى : أنهم لا يخامر نفوسهم تشوف إلى أخذ شيء مما أوتيه المهاجرون من فيْء بني النضير .ويجوز وجه آخر بأن يحمل لفظ حاجة على استعماله الحقيقي اسم مصدر الاحتياج فإن الحاجة بهذا المعنى يصح وقوعها في الصدور لأنها من الوجدانيات والانفعالات . ومعنى نفي وجدان الاحتياج في صدورهم أنهم لفرط حبهم للمهاجرين صاروا لا يخامر نفوسهم أنهم مفتقرون إلى شيء مما يُؤتاه المهاجرون ، أي فهم أغنياء عما يؤتاه المهاجرون فلا تستشرف نفوسهم إلى شيء مما يؤتاه المهاجرون بَلْهَ أن يتطلبوه .وتكون ( مِن ) في قوله تعالى : مما أوتوا } للتعليل ، أي حاجة لأجل ما أوتيه المهاجرون ، أو ابتدائية ، أي حاجة ناشئة عما أوتيه المهاجرون فيفيد انتفاء وجدان الحاجة في نفوسهم وانتفاء أسباب ذلك الوجدان ومناشئِه المعتادة في الناس تبعاً للمنافسة والغبطة ، وقد دل انتفاء أسباب الحاجة على متعلق حاجة المحذوف إذ التقدير : ولا يجدون في نفوسهم حاجة لشيء أوتيه المهاجرون .والإيثار : ترجيح شيء على غيره بمكرمة أو منفعة .والمعنى : يُؤثرونَ على أنفسهم في ذلك اختياراً منهم وهذا أعلى درجة مما أفاده قوله : { ولا يجدون في صدورهم حاجة مما أوتوا } فلذلك عقب به ولم يُذكر مفعول { يُؤثِرونَ } لدلالة قوله : { مما أوتوا } عليه .ومن إيثارهم المهاجرين ما روي في «الصحيح» أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم دعا الأنصار ليقطع لهم قطائع بنخل البحرين فقالوا : لا إلا أن تقطع لإِخواننا من المهاجرين مثلها .وإما إيثار الواحد منهم على غيره منهم فما رواه البخاري عن أبي هريرة قال : «أتى رجل رسولَ الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال : يا رسول الله أصابني الجهد . فأرسل في نسائه فلم يجد عندهنّ شيئاً فقال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ألاَ رجل يُضيف هذا الليلةَ رحمه الله ، فقام رجل من الأنصار ( هو أبو طلحة ) فقال : أنا يا رسول الله ، فذهب إلى أهله فقال لامرأته : هذا ضيف رسول الله لا تدَّخريه شيئاً ، فقالت : والله ما عندي إلا قُوتُ الصِبية . قال : فإذا أراد الصبية العَشاء فنوِّميهم وتعالَي فأطفئي السراج ونطوي بطوننا الليلة . فإذا دخل الضيف فإذا أهوى ليأكل فقومي إلى السراج تُري أنككِ تصلحينه فأطفئيه وأَرِيه أنَّا نأكل . فقعدوا وأكل الضيف .وذكرت قصص من هذا القبيل في التفاسير ، قيل : نزلت هذه الآية في قصة أبي طلحة وقيل غير ذلك .وجملة { ولو كان بهم خصاصة } في موضع الحال .و { لو } وصلية وهي التي تدل على مجرد تعليق جوابها بشرط يفيد حالة لا يُظنّ حصول الجواب عند حصولها . والتقدير : لو كان بهم خصاصة لآثروا على أنفسهم فيُعلم أن إيثارهم في الأحوال التي دون ذلك بالأحرى دون إفادة الامتناع . وقد بينا ذلك عند قوله تعالى : { فلن يقبل من أحدهم ملء الأرض ذهباً ولو افتدى به } في سورة [ آل عمران : 91 ] .والخصاصة : شدة الاحتياج .وتذكير فعل كان } لأجل كون تأنيث الخصاصة ليس حقيقياً ، ولأنه فُصل بين { كان } واسمها بالمجرور . والباء للملابسة .وجملة { ومن يوق شح نفسه فأولئك هم المفلحون } تذييل ، والواو اعتراضية ، فإن التذييل من قبيل الاعتراض في آخر الكلام على الرأي الصحيح . وتذييل الكلام بذكر فضل من يوقون شح أنفسهم بعد قوله : { ويؤثرون على أنفسهم ولو كان بهم خصاصة } يشير إلى أن إيثارهم على أنفسهم حتى في حالة الخصاصة هو سلامة من شح الأنفس فكأنه قيل لسلامتهم من شح الأنفس { ومن يوق شح نفسه فأولئك هم المفلحون } .والشح بضم الشين وكسرها : غريزة في النفس بمَنْع ما هو لها ، وهو قريب من معنى البخل . وقال الطيبي : الفرق بين الشح والبخل عسير جداً وقد أشار في «الكشاف» إلى الفرق بينهما بما يقتضي أن البخل أثر الشح وهو أن يمنع أحد ما يراد منه بَذْلُه وقد قال تعالى : { وأحضرت الأنفس الشح } [ النساء : 128 ] أي جعل الشح حاضراً معها لا يفارقها ، وأضيف في هذه الآية إلى النفس لذلك فهو غريزة لا تسلم منها نفس .وفي الحديث في بيان أفضل الصدقة «أن تصَّدَّق وأنت صحيح شحيح تخشى الفقر وتأمُل الغِنى» ولكن النفوس تتفاوت في هذا المقدار فإذا غلب عليها بمنع المعروف والخير فذلك مذموم ويتفاوت ذمه بتفاوت ما يمنعه . قال وقد أحسن وصفه من قال ، لم أقف على قائله: ... يمارس نفساً بين جَنْبَيْه كَزَّةًإذا هَمَّ بالمعروف قالت له مهلاً ... فمن وقي شح نفسه ، أي وُقي من أن يكون الشح المذموم خُلقاً له ، لأنه إذا وُقي هذا الخُلقَ سلِم من كل مواقع ذمه . فإن وقي من بعضه كان له من الفلاح بمقدار ما وُقيه .واسم الإِشارة لتعظيم هذا الصنف من الناس .وصيغة القصر المؤداة بضمير الفصل للمبالغة لكثرة الفلاح الذي يترتب على وقاية شح النفس حتى كأن جنس المفلح مقصور على ذلك المُوقَى .ومن المفسرين من جعل { والذين تبوؤا الدار } ابتداء كلام للثناء على الأنصار بمناسبة الثناء على المهاجرين وهؤلاء لم يجعلوا للأنصار حظاً في ما أفاء الله على رسوله من أهل القرى وقصروا قوله : { ما أفاء الله على رسوله من أهل القرى } [ الحشر : 7 ] على قرى خاصة هي : قريظة . وفَدَك ، وخيبر . والنفع ، وعُرينة ، ووادي القُرى ، ورووا أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم لما أفاء الله عليه فيئَها قال للأنصار : \" إن شئتم قاسمتم المهاجرين من أموالكم ودياركم وشاركتموهم في هذه الغنيمة ، وإن شئتم أمسكتم أموالكم وتركتم لهم هذا \" ؟ فقالوا : بل نقسم لهم من أموالنا ونترك لهم هذه الغنيمة ، فنزلت آيةُ { ما أفاء الله على رسوله من أهل القرى } الآية [ الحشر : 7 ] .ومنهم من قصر هذه الآية على فَيء بني النضير وكل ذلك خروج عن مهيع انتظام آي هذه السورة بعضها مع بعض وتفكيك لنظم الكلام وتناسبه مع وهن الأخبار التي رووها في ذلك فلا ينبغي التعويل عليه . وعلى هذا التفسير يكون عطف { والذين تبوؤا الدار } عطفَ جملةٍ على جملة ، واسم الموصول مبتدأ وجملة { يحبون من هاجر إليهم } خبراً عن المبتدأ ."

لأن التبوء إنما يكون في الأماكن . ومن قبلهم : من صلة تبوأ ، والمعنى : والذين تبوءوا الدار من قبل المهاجرين واعتقدوا الإيمان وأخلصوه ; لأن الإيمان ليس بمكان يتبوأ ; كقوله تعالى : فأجمعوا أمركم وشركاءكم أي وادعوا شركاءكم ; ذكره أبو علي والزمخشري وغيرهما . ويكون من باب قوله : علفتها تبنا وماء باردا . ويجوز حمله على حذف المضاف كأنه قال : تبوءوا الدار ومواضع الإيمان . ويجوز حمله على ما دل عليه تبوأ ; كأنه قال : لزموا الدار ولزموا الإيمان فلم يفارقوهما . ويجوز أن يكون تبوأ الإيمان على طريق المثل ; كما تقول : تبوأ من بني فلان الصميم . والتبوء : التمكن والاستقرار . وليس يريد أن الأنصار آمنوا قبل المهاجرين ، بل أراد آمنوا قبل هجرة النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم إليهم .الثانية : واختلف أيضا هل هذه الآية مقطوعة مما قبلها أو معطوفة ; فتأول قوم أنها معطوفة على قوله : للفقراء المهاجرين وأن الآيات التي في الحشر كلها معطوفة بعضها على بعض . ولو تأملوا ذلك وأنصفوا لوجدوه على خلاف ما ذهبوا إليه ; لأن الله تعالى يقول : هو الذي أخرج الذين كفروا من أهل الكتاب من ديارهم لأول الحشر ما ظننتم أن يخرجوا إلى قوله الفاسقين ، فأخبر عن بني النضير وبني قينقاع . ثم قال : وما أفاء الله على رسوله منهم فما أوجفتم عليه من خيل ولا ركاب ولكن الله يسلط رسله على من يشاء فأخبر أن ذلك للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ; لأنه لم يوجف عليه حين خلوه . وما تقدم فيهم من القتال وقطع شجرهم فقد كانوا رجعوا عنه وانقطع ذلك الأمر . ثم قال : ما أفاء الله على رسوله من أهل القرى فلله وللرسول ولذي القربى واليتامى والمساكين وابن السبيل وهذا كلام غير معطوف على الأول . وكذا والذين تبوءوا الدار والإيمان ابتداء كلام في مدح الأنصار والثناء عليهم ; فإنهم سلموا ذلك الفيء للمهاجرين ; وكأنه قال ; الفيء للفقراء المهاجرين ; والأنصار يحبون لهم ولم يحسدوهم على ما صفا لهم من الفيء . وكذا والذين جاءوا من بعدهم ابتداء كلام ; والخبر : يقولون ربنا اغفر لنا . وقال إسماعيل بن إسحاق : إن قوله والذين تبوءوا الدار والذين جاءوا معطوف على ما قبل ، وأنهم شركاء في الفيء ; أي هذا المال للمهاجرين والذين تبوءوا الدار . وقال مالك بن أوس : قرأ عمر بن الخطاب [ ص: 22 ] رضي الله عنه هذه الآية إنما الصدقات للفقراء فقال : هذه لهؤلاء . ثم قرأ واعلموا أنما غنمتم من شيء فأن لله خمسه فقال : هذه لهؤلاء . ثم قرأ ما أفاء الله على رسوله حتى بلغ للفقراء المهاجرين ، والذين تبوءوا الدار والإيمان ، والذين جاءوا من بعدهم ثم قال : لئن عشت ليأتين الراعي وهو بسرو حمير نصيبه منها لم يعرق فيها جبينه . وقيل : إنه دعا المهاجرين والأنصار واستشارهم فيما فتح الله عليه من ذلك ، وقال لهم : تثبتوا الأمر وتدبروه ثم اغدوا علي . ففكر في ليلته فتبين له أن هذه الآيات في ذلك أنزلت . فلما غدوا عليه قال : قد مررت البارحة بالآيات التي في سورة \" الحشر \" وتلا : ما أفاء الله على رسوله من أهل القرى إلى قوله : للفقراء المهاجرين فلما بلغ قوله : أولئك هم الصادقون قال : ما هي لهؤلاء فقط . وتلا قوله : والذين جاءوا من بعدهم إلى قوله رءوف رحيم ، ثم قال : ما بقي أحد من أهل الإسلام إلا وقد دخل في ذلك . والله أعلم .الثالثة : روى مالك عن زيد بن أسلم عن أبيه أن عمر قال : لولا من يأتي من آخر الناس ما فتحت قرية إلا قسمتها كما قسم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم خيبر . وفي الروايات المستفيضة من الطرق الكثيرة : أن عمر أبقى سواد العراق ومصر وما ظهر عليه من الغنائم ; لتكون من أعطيات المقاتلة وأرزاق الحشوة والذراري ، وأن الزبير وبلالا وغير واحد من الصحابة أرادوه على قسم ما فتح عليهم ; فكره ذلك منهم واختلف فيما فعل من ذلك ; فقيل : إنه استطاب أنفس أهل الجيش ; فمن رضي له بترك حظه بغير ثمن ليبقيه للمسلمين قلة . ومن أبى أعطاه ثمن حظه . فمن قال : إنما أبقى الأرض بعد استطابة أنفس القوم جعل فعله كفعل النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ; لأنه قسم خيبر ، لأن اشتراءه إياها وترك من ترك عن طيب نفسه بمنزلة قسمها . وقيل : إنه أبقاها بغير شيء أعطاه أهل الجيوش . وقيل : إنه تأول في ذلك قول الله سبحانه وتعالى : للفقراء المهاجرين إلى قوله : ربنا إنك رءوف رحيم على ما تقدم . والله أعلم .الرابعة : واختلف العلماء في قسمة العقار ; فقال مالك : للإمام أن يوقفها لمصالح المسلمين . وقال أبو حنيفة : الإمام مخير بين أن يقسمها أو يجعلها وقفا لمصالح المسلمين . وقال الشافعي : ليس للإمام حبسها عنهم بغير رضاهم ، بل يقسمها عليهم كسائر الأموال . فمن طاب نفسا عن حقه للإمام أن يجعله وقفا عليهم فله . ومن لم تطب نفسه فهو أحق بماله . وعمر رضي الله عنه استطاب نفوس الغانمين واشتراها منهم .[ ص: 23 ] قلت : وعلى هذا يكون قوله : والذين جاءوا من بعدهم مقطوعا مما قبله ، وأنهم ندبوا بالدعاء للأولين والثناء عليهم .الخامسة : قال ابن وهب : سمعت مالكا يذكر فضل المدينة على غيرها من الآفاق فقال : إن المدينة تبوئت بالإيمان والهجرة ، وإن غيرها من القرى افتتحت بالسيف ; ثم قرأ والذين تبوءوا الدار والإيمان من قبلهم يحبون من هاجر إليهم الآية . وقد مضى الكلام في هذا ، وفي فضل الصلاة في المسجدين : المسجد الحرام ومسجد المدينة ; فلا معنى للإعادة .السادسة : قوله تعالى : ولا يجدون في صدورهم حاجة مما أوتوا يعني لا يحسدون المهاجرين على ما خصوا به من مال الفيء وغيره ; كذلك قال الناس . وفيه تقدير حذف مضافين ; المعنى مس حاجة من فقد ما أوتوا . وكل ما يجد الإنسان في صدره مما يحتاج إلى إزالته فهو حاجة . وكان المهاجرون في دور الأنصار ، فلما غنم عليه الصلاة والسلام أموال بني النضير ، دعا الأنصار وشكرهم فيما صنعوا مع المهاجرين في إنزالهم إياهم في منازلهم ، وإشراكهم في أموالهم . ثم قال : إن أحببتم قسمت ما أفاء الله علي من بني النضير بينكم وبينهم ، وكان المهاجرون على ما هم عليه من السكنى في مساكنكم وأموالكم ، وإن أحببتم أعطيتهم وخرجوا من دوركم . فقال سعد بن عبادة وسعد بن معاذ : بل نقسمه بين المهاجرين ، ويكونون في دورنا كما كانوا . ونادت الأنصار : رضينا وسلمنا يا رسول الله ، فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : اللهم ارحم الأنصار وأبناء الأنصار . وأعطى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم المهاجرين ولم يعط الأنصار شيئا إلا الثلاثة الذين ذكرناهم . ويحتمل أن يريد به ولا يجدون في صدورهم حاجة مما أوتوا إذا كان قليلا بل يقنعون به ويرضون عنه . وقد كانوا على هذه الحالة حين حياة النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم دنيا ، ثم كانوا عليه بعد موته صلى الله عليه وسلم بحكم الدنيا . وقد أنذرهم النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وقال : \" سترون بعدي أثرة فاصبروا حتى تلقوني على الحوض \" .السابعة : قوله تعالى : ويؤثرون على أنفسهم ولو كان بهم خصاصة في الترمذي عن أبي هريرة : أن رجلا بات به ضيف فلم يكن عنده إلا قوته وقوت صبيانه ; فقال لامرأته : نومي الصبية ، وأطفئي السراج ، وقربي للضيف ما عندك ; فنزلت هذه الآية ويؤثرون على أنفسهم ولو كان بهم خصاصة [ ص: 24 ] قال : هذا حديث حسن صحيح . خرجه مسلم أيضا . وخرج عن أبي هريرة قال : جاء رجل إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال : إني مجهود . فأرسل إلى بعض نسائه فقالت : والذي بعثك بالحق ما عندي إلا ماء . ثم أرسل إلى الأخرى فقالت مثل ذلك ; حتى قلن كلهن مثل ذلك : لا والذي بعثك بالحق ، ما عندي إلا ماء . فقال : \" من يضيف هذا الليلة رحمه الله \" ، فقام رجل من الأنصار فقال : أنا يا رسول الله . فانطلق به إلى رحله ، فقال لامرأته : هل عندك شيء ؟ قالت : لا ، إلا قوت صبياني . قال : فعلليهم بشيء ، فإذا دخل ضيفنا فأطفئي السراج وأريه أنا نأكل ; فإذا أهوى ليأكل فقومي إلى السراج حتى تطفئيه . قال : فقعدوا وأكل الضيف . فلما أصبح غدا على النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال : \" قد عجب الله - عز وجل - من صنيعكما بضيفكما الليلة \" . وفي رواية عن أبي هريرة قال : جاء رجل إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ليضيفه فلم يكن عنده ما يضيفه . فقال : \" ألا رجل يضيف هذا رحمه الله \" فقام رجل من الأنصار يقال له أبو طلحة ، فانطلق به إلى رحله . . . ; وساق الحديث بنحو الذي قبله ، وذكر فيه نزول الآية . وذكر المهدوي عن أبي هريرة أن هذا نزل في ثابت بن قيس ورجل من الأنصار - نزل به ثابت - يقال له أبو المتوكل ، فلم يكن عند أبي المتوكل إلا قوته وقوت صبيانه ; فقال لامرأته : أطفئي السراج ونومي الصبية ; وقدم ما كان عنده إلى ضيفه . وكذا ذكر النحاس قال : قال أبو هريرة : نزل برجل من الأنصار - يقال له أبو المتوكل - ثابت بن قيس ضيفا ، ولم يكن عنده إلا قوته وقوت صبيانه ; فقال لامرأته : أطفئي السراج ونومي الصبية ; فنزلت ويؤثرون على أنفسهم ولو كان بهم خصاصة إلى قوله : فأولئك هم المفلحون . وقيل : إن فاعل ذلك أبو طلحة . وذكر القشيري أبو نصر عبد الرحيم بن عبد الكريم : وقال ابن عمر : أهدي لرجل من أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم رأس شاة فقال : إن أخي فلانا وعياله أحوج إلى هذا منا ; فبعثه إليهم ، فلم يزل يبعث به واحد إلى آخر حتى تداولها سبعة أبيات ، حتى رجعت إلى أولئك ; فنزلت : ويؤثرون على أنفسهم . ذكره الثعلبي عن أنس قال : أهدي لرجل من الصحابة رأس شاة ، وكان مجهودا فوجه به إلى جار له ، فتداولته سبعة أنفس في سبعة أبيات ، ثم عاد إلى [ ص: 25 ] الأول ; فنزلت : ويؤثرون على أنفسهم الآية . وقال ابن عباس قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم للأنصار يوم بني النضير : \" إن شئتم قسمت للمهاجرين من دياركم وأموالكم وشاركتموهم في هذه الغنيمة ، وإن شئتم كانت لكم دياركم وأموالكم ولم نقسم لكم من الغنيمة شيئا \" ، فقالت الأنصار : بل نقسم لإخواننا من ديارنا وأموالنا ونؤثرهم بالغنيمة ; فنزلت ويؤثرون على أنفسهم الآية . والأول أصح . وفي الصحيحين عن أنس : أن الرجل كان يجعل للنبي صلى الله عليه وسلم النخلات من أرضه حتى فتحت عليه قريظة والنضير ، فجعل بعد ذلك يرد عليه ما كان أعطاه . لفظ مسلم . وقال الزهري عن أنس بن مالك : لما قدم المهاجرون من مكة المدينة قدموا وليس بأيديهم شيء ، وكان الأنصار أهل الأرض والعقار ، فقاسمهم الأنصار على أن أعطوهم أنصاف ثمار أموالهم كل عام ويكفونهم العمل والمؤونة ; وكانت أم أنس بن مالك تدعى أم سليم ، وكانت أم عبد الله بن أبي طلحة ، كان أخا لأنس لأمه ; وكانت أعطت أم أنس رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم عذاقا لها ; فأعطاها رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أم أيمن مولاته ، ثم أسامة بن زيد . قال ابن شهاب : فأخبرني أنس بن مالك : أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم لما فرغ من قتال أهل خيبر وانصرف إلى المدينة ، رد المهاجرون إلى الأنصار منائحهم التي كانوا منحوهم من ثمارهم . قال : فرد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى أمي عذاقها ، وأعطى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أم أيمن مكانهن من حائطه . خرجه مسلم أيضا .الثامنة : الإيثار : هو تقديم الغير على النفس وحظوظها الدنيوية ، ورغبة في الحظوظ الدينية . وذلك ينشأ عن قوة اليقين وتوكيد المحبة ، والصبر على المشقة . يقال : آثرته بكذا ; أي خصصته به وفضلته . ومفعول الإيثار محذوف ; أي يؤثرونهم على أنفسهم بأموالهم ومنازلهم ، لا عن غنى بل مع احتياجهم إليها ; حسب ما تقدم بيانه . وفي موطأ مالك : أنه بلغه عن عائشة زوج النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ، أن مسكينا سألها وهي صائمة وليس في بيتها إلا رغيف ; فقالت لمولاة لها : أعطيه إياه ; فقالت : ليس لك ما تفطرين عليه ؟ فقالت : أعطيه إياه . قالت : ففعلت . قالت : فلما أمسينا أهدى لنا أهل بيت أو إنسان ما كان يهدى لنا : شاة وكفنها . فدعتني عائشة فقالت : كلي من هذا ، فهذا خير من قرصك . قال علماؤنا : هذا من المال الرابح ، والفعل الزاكي عند الله تعالى يعجل منه ما يشاء ، ولا ينقص ذلك مما يدخره عنه . ومن ترك شيئا لله لم يجد فقده . وعائشة رضي الله عنها في فعلها هذا من الذين أثنى الله عليهم [ ص: 26 ] بأنهم يؤثرون على أنفسهم مع ما هم فيه من الخصاصة ، وأن من فعل ذلك فقد وقي شح نفسه وأفلح فلاحا لا خسارة بعده . ومعنى ( شاة وكفنها ) فإن العرب - أو بعض العرب أو بعض وجوههم - كان هذا من طعامهم ، يأتون إلى الشاة أو الخروف إذا سلخوه غطوه كله بعجين البر وكفنوه به ثم علقوه في التنور ، فلا يخرج من ودكه شيء إلا في ذلك الكفن ; وذلك من طيب الطعام عندهم . وروى النسائي عن نافع أن ابن عمر اشتكى ، واشتهى عنبا ، فاشتري له عنقود بدرهم ، فجاء مسكين فسأل ; فقال : أعطوه إياه ; فخالف إنسان فاشتراه بدرهم ، ثم جاء به إلى ابن عمر ، فجاء المسكين فسأل ; فقال : أعطوه إياه ; ثم خالف إنسان فاشتراه بدرهم ، ثم جاء به إليه ; فأراد السائل أن يرجع فمنع . ولو علم ابن عمر أنه ذلك العنقود ما ذاقه ; لأن ما خرج لله لا يعود فيه . وذكر ابن المبارك قال : أخبرنا محمد بن مطرف قال : حدثنا أبو حازم عن عبد الرحمن بن سعيد بن يربوع عن مالك الدار : أن عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه أخذ أربعمائة دينار ، فجعلها في صرة ثم قال للغلام : اذهب بها إلى أبي عبيدة بن الجراح ، ثم تلكأ ساعة في البيت حتى تنظر ماذا يصنع بها . فذهب بها الغلام إليه فقال : يقول لك أمير المؤمنين : اجعل هذه في بعض حاجتك . فقال : وصله الله ورحمه ، ثم قال : تعالي يا جارية ، اذهبي بهذه السبعة إلى فلان ، وبهذه الخمسة إلى فلان ; حتى أنفذها . فرجع الغلام إلى عمر ، فأخبره فوجده قد أعد مثلها لمعاذ بن جبل ; وقال : اذهب بهذا إلى معاذ بن جبل ; وتلكأ في البيت ساعة حتى تنظر ماذا يصنع ، فذهب بها إليه فقال : يقول لك أمير المؤمنين : اجعل هذه في بعض حاجتك ، فقال : رحمه الله ووصله ، وقال : يا جارية ، اذهبي إلى بيت فلان بكذا وبيت فلان بكذا ، فاطلعت امرأة معاذ فقالت : ونحن والله مساكين فأعطنا . ولم يبق في الخرقة إلا ديناران قد جاء بهما إليها . فرجع الغلام إلى عمر فأخبره فسر بذلك عمر وقال : إنهم إخوة ! بعضهم من بعض . ونحوه عن عائشة رضي الله عنها في إعطاء معاوية إياها ، وكان عشرة آلاف ، وكان المنكدر دخل عليها . فإن قيل : وردت أخبار صحيحة في النهي عن التصدق بجميع ما يملكه المرء ، قيل له : إنما كره ذلك في حق من لا يوثق منه الصبر على الفقر ، وخاف أن يتعرض للمسألة إذا فقد ما ينفقه . فأما الأنصار الذين أثنى الله عليهم بالإيثار على أنفسهم ، فلم يكونوا بهذه الصفة ، بل كانوا كما قال الله تعالى : والصابرين في البأساء والضراء وحين البأس . وكان الإيثار فيهم أفضل من الإمساك . والإمساك لمن لا يصبر ويتعرض للمسألة أولى من الإيثار . وروي أن رجلا جاء إلى النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم بمثل البيضة من الذهب ، فقال : هذه [ ص: 27 ] صدقة ، فرماه بها وقال : يأتي أحدكم بجميع ما يملكه فيتصدق به ثم يقعد يتكفف الناس . والله أعلم .التاسعة : والإيثار بالنفس فوق الإيثار بالمال وإن عاد إلى النفس . ومن الأمثال السائرة :تجود بالنفس إذ أنت الضنين بها     والجود بالنفس أقصى غاية الجودومن عبارات الصوفية الرشيقة في حد المحبة : أنها الإيثار ، ألا ترى أن امرأة العزيز لما تناهت في حبها ليوسف عليه السلام ، آثرته على نفسها فقالت : أنا راودته عن نفسه . وأفضل الجود بالنفس الجود على حماية رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ، ففي الصحيح أن أبا طلحة ترس على النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يوم أحد ، وكان النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يتطلع ليرى القوم . فيقول له أبو طلحة : لا تشرف يا رسول الله ! لا يصيبونك ! نحري دون نحرك ، ووقى بيده رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فشلت . وقال حذيفة العدوي : انطلقت يوم اليرموك أطلب ابن عم لي - ومعي شيء من الماء - وأنا أقول : إن كان به رمق سقيته ، فإذا أنا به ، فقلت له : أسقيك ، فأشار برأسه أن نعم ، فإذا أنا برجل يقول : آه ! آه ! فأشار إلي ابن عمي أن انطلق إليه ، فإذا هو هشام بن العاص فقلت : أسقيك ؟ فأشار أن نعم . فسمع آخر يقول : آه ! آه ! فأشار هشام أن انطلق إليه فجئته فإذا هو قد مات . فرجعت إلى هشام فإذا هو قد مات . فرجعت إلى ابن عمي فإذا هو قد مات . وقال أبو يزيد البسطامي : ما غلبني أحد ما غلبني شاب من أهل بلخ ! قدم علينا حاجا فقال لي : يا أبا يزيد ، ما حد الزهد عندكم ؟ فقلت : إن وجدنا أكلنا ، وإن فقدنا صبرنا . فقال : هكذا كلاب بلخ عندنا . فقلت : وما حد الزهد عندكم ؟ قال : إن فقدنا شكرنا ، وإن وجدنا آثرنا . وسئل ذو النون المصري : ما حد الزاهد المنشرح صدره ؟ قال ثلاث : تفريق المجموع ، وترك طلب المفقود ، والإيثار عند القوت . وحكي عن أبي الحسن الأنطاكي : أنه اجتمع عنده نيف وثلاثون رجلا بقرية من قرى الري ، ومعهم أرغفة معدودة لا تشبع جميعهم ، فكسروا الرغفان وأطفئوا السراج وجلسوا للطعام ; فلما رفع فإذا الطعام بحاله لم يأكل منه أحد شيئا ; إيثارا لصاحبه على نفسه .العاشرة : قوله تعالى : ولو كان بهم خصاصة الخصاصة : الحاجة التي تختل بها الحال . وأصلها من الاختصاص وهو انفراد بالأمر . فالخصاصة الانفراد بالحاجة ; أي ولو كان بهم فاقة وحاجة . ومنه قول الشاعر : [ ص: 28 ]أما الربيع إذا تكون خصاصة     عاش السقيم به وأثرى المقترالحادية عشرة : قوله تعالى : ومن يوق شح نفسه فأولئك هم المفلحون الشح والبخل سواء ; يقال : رجل شحيح بين الشح والشح والشحاحة . قال عمرو بن كلثوم :ترى اللحز الشحيح إذا أمرت     عليه لماله فيها مهيناوجعل بعض أهل اللغة الشح أشد من البخل . وفي الصحاح : الشح البخل مع حرص ; تقول : شححت ( بالكسر ) تشح . وشححت أيضا تشح وتشح . ورجل شحيح ، وقوم شحاح وأشحة . والمراد بالآية : الشح بالزكاة وما ليس بفرض من صلة ذوي الأرحام والضيافة ، وما شاكل ذلك . فليس بشحيح ولا بخيل من أنفق في ذلك وإن أمسك عن نفسه . ومن وسع على نفسه ولم ينفق فيما ذكرناه من الزكوات والطاعات فلم يوق شح نفسه . وروى الأسود عن ابن مسعود أن رجلا أتاه فقال له : إني أخاف أن أكون قد هلكت ؟ قال : وما ذاك ؟ قال : سمعت الله عز وجل يقول : ومن يوق شح نفسه فأولئك هم المفلحون وأنا رجل شحيح لا أكاد أن أخرج من يدي شيئا . فقال ابن مسعود : ليس ذلك بالشح الذي ذكره الله تعالى في القرآن ، إنما الشح الذي ذكره الله تعالى في القرآن أن تأكل مال أخيك ظلما ، ولكن ذلك البخل ، وبئس الشيء البخل . ففرق رضي الله عنه بين الشح والبخل . وقال طاوس : البخل أن يبخل الإنسان بما في يده ، والشح أن يشح بما في أيدي الناس ، يحب أن يكون له ما في أيديهم بالحل والحرام ، لا يقنع . ابن جبير : الشح منع الزكاة وادخار الحرام . ابن عيينة : الشح الظلم . الليث : ترك الفرائض وانتهاك المحارم . ابن عباس : من اتبع هواه ولم يقبل الإيمان فذلك الشحيح . ابن زيد : من لم يأخذ شيئا لشيء نهاه الله عنه ، ولم يدعه الشح على أن يمنع شيئا من شيء أمره الله به ، فقد وقاه الله شح نفسه . وقال أنس : قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم : \" بريء من الشح من أدى الزكاة ، وقرى الضيف ، وأعطى في النائبة \" . وعنه أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم كان يدعو : \" اللهم إني أعوذ بك من شح نفسي وإسرافها ووساوسها \" . وقال أبو الهياج الأسدي : رأيت رجلا في الطواف يدعو : اللهم قني شح نفسي . لا يزيد على ذلك شيئا ، فقلت له ؟ فقال : إذا وقيت شح نفسي لم أسرق ولم أزن ولم أفعل . فإذا الرجل عبد الرحمن بن عوف .[ ص: 29 ] قلت : يدل على هذا قوله صلى الله عليه وسلم : \" اتقوا الظلم ؛ فإن الظلم ظلمات يوم القيامة ، واتقوا الشح ؛ فإن الشح أهلك من كان قبلكم ، حملهم على أن سفكوا دماءهم واستحلوا محارمهم \" . وقد بيناه في آخر \" آل عمران \" . وقال كسرى لأصحابه : أي شيء أضر بابن آدم ؟ قالوا : الفقر . فقال كسرى : الشح أضر من الفقر ; لأن الفقير إذا وجد شبع ، والشحيح إذا وجد لم يشبع أبدا ."

The word tabawwu' means 'to make dwelling in the abode'. The word dar refers to Madinah which has a special distinction. Therefore, Imam Malik (رح) ، from one point of view, regarded Madinah Tayyibah as the most distinguishable of all the cities in the world. He used to say that wherever Islam reached and any city that was conquered, it was conquered by means of jihad - including Makkah Mukarramah. Madinah Tayyibah is the only exception. It was conquered by means of 'Iman. [ Qurtubi ].</p><p>In this verse, under the word tabawwu' [ to settle in an abode ] the words dar [ home ] and 'iman [ faith ] are coupled. It could be objected that a 'home' can be found in a place where a person might settle in, but 'faith' is not an 'abode' where a person might find a place to settle in. Some of the scholars take the position that in this context the following verbs اَخلَصُوا or تَمَکَّنُوا to be understood and they mean \"These are the people who settled in their abode and became sincere and strong in their faith\". It is possible to take the word 'faith' in its metaphorical sense, that is in the sense that 'it is a fortified house' where refuge is taken. The phrase min qablihim [ before them ] describes another characteristic of Ansar, which means that they had settled in Madinah before the Emigrants, while Madinah was so important a city that all the Muslims living in Makkah were ordered to emigrate to it and it became the center of Islam.</p><p>The second characteristic of the Helpers is described in يُحِبُّونَ مَنْ هَاجَرَ‌ إِلَيْهِمْ (...have love for those who emigrated to them...59:9) The Emigrants from Makkah came to the Helpers, deprived and denuded of all their possessions. Normally, no community is willing to allow such a large number of distressed people to settle in their city. Instead, the quarrels between natives and emigrants are found everywhere. But the Ansar received them with open arms and made them equal partners in their belongings. The bond of love and brotherhood which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ established between the Emigrants and the Helpers, and to which this verse bears an eloquent testimony, stands unrivalled in the whole history of human relationships. There was no dearth of the Helpers who were eager to take on the Emigrants. In fact, for each Emigrant there were several applications to take him on. There were many instances in which lots had to be cast. When the lot of a particular Helper fell in favour of a particular Emigrant, he was handed to him. [ Mazhari ]</p><p>The third characteristic of the Helpers is described in وَلَا يَجِدُونَ فِي صُدُورِ‌هِمْ حَاجَةً مِّمَّا أُوتُوا (...and do not feel in their hearts any need for what is given to the former ones [ from fai'], ...[ 59:9] \". This statement is concerned with the banishment of Banu Nadir and their orchards and homes falling into Muslim hands.</p><p>Distribution of Banu Nadir's properties</p><p>As stated earlier, the relevant verse has given discretionary powers to the Holy Prophet ﷺ in matters of distributing the fai' property. It was a time when the Muhajirin (Emigrants) had neither homes of their own nor any property. They lived in the homes of the Ansar, and worked on their farms to earn their livelihood. When the wealth of Banu Nadir and Banu Qainuqa` were obtained as fai', the Messenger of Allah ﷺ called the leader of the Ansar, Sayyidna Thabit Ibn Qais Ibn Shammas ؓ ، and asked him to bring his people to him. He asked: \"O Messenger of Allah, should I call my tribe of the Ansar, Banu Khazraj, or all of the tribes of the Ansar?\" He replied: \"All of them.\" They all gathered. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ delivered a sermon in which he spoke highly of the Ansar as to the manner in which they accommodated the Refugee brethren. He said it was a work of great determination and courage. After that he said: 'Allah has granted you the wealth of Banu Nadir. If you wish, I will divide the wealth between the Muhajirin and the Ansar; and the Refugees will remain as usual in the homes of the Ansar. Or if you wish, the wealth may be distributed among the homeless Refugees; and they may move out of your homes and settle in their own homes.'</p><p>Having heard this sermon, two of the great chiefs of the Ansar, Sayyidna Sa'd Ibn ` Ubadah and Sa'd Ibn Mu` adh ؓ - stood and said: \"0 Messenger of Allah, we are of the view that the entire wealth of fai' be distributed among the Refugee brethren, and in addition they may continue to reside in our homes as usual.\" At this all the Ansar unanimously said, \"We concur with this decision and are happy with it.\" On that occasion, the Holy Prophet ﷺ supplicated for the Ansar and their children. He then distributed the entire fai' among the Muhajirin. Only two of the Ansar received a grant from the fai' , because they were very poor. Their names are Sayyidna Sahl Ibn Hunaif ؓ and Abu Dujanah ؓ . Sayyidna Sa'd Ibn Mu` adh ؓ was given a sword which was a distinguished sword of Ibn Abil-Huqaiq. [ Mazharl with reference to Sabi-ur-Rashad by Muhammad Ibn Yusuf As-Salihi ]</p><p>The present verse admires the Ansar on this attitude by saying, وَلَا يَجِدُونَ فِي صُدُورِ‌هِمْ حَاجَةً مِّمَّا أُوتُوا (...and do not feel in their hearts any need for what is given to the former ones [ from fai'], ....59:9). The word 'need' means 'any item of need'. The verse means 'Whatever the Muhajirin were granted in this distribution, the Ansar happily accepted it as if they had no need for any of those items. It was inconceivable that they would complain about it enviously.' When Bahrain was conquered, the same spirit of self-sacrifice was displayed again by the Ansr. The Holy Prophet ﷺ expressed his intention to distribute the entire conquered lands of that territory among the Ansar, but they courteously refused to accept any share of it unless a similar share was granted to the Muhajirin.</p><p>The fourth characteristic of the Ansar is described in the verse is: وَيُؤْثِرُ‌ونَ عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَلَوْ كَانَ بِهِمْ خَصَاصَةٌ (...and give preference (to them) over themselves, even though they are in poverty ....59:9). The word khasasah means 'poverty' and the word ` ithar means 'to prefer the wish, need and desire of others above those of oneself. The meaning of the verse is that the Ansar used to prefer the needs of others (i.e. the Muhajirin,) to their own needs. That is, the former used to fulfill the needs of the latter first, then they would fulfill their own needs, even though they themselves were poor and needy.</p><p>For the interpretation of the Qur'anic verses, there is no need to recount incidents. But because they develop in human beings the highest degree of human qualities and bring about a reform in their lives, the commentators have recounted these events in detail on this occasion, especially Qurtubi. We cite below a few of them from his commentary.</p><p>It is recorded in Tirmidhi on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ that one night a guest came to ansari's house. The latter had only as much food as he and his children could eat. He said to his wife: 'Put the children off to sleep somehow, and put out the lamp. Then place the food in front of the guest, and sit next to him so that he may be under the impression that we too are eating, but we will not eat so that the guest may be able to eat comfortably.' At this, the present verse was revealed. [ At-Tirmidhi has rated this hadith as 'hasan, sahih'].</p><p>Tirmidhi records another narration on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ that a person came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said: \"I am hungry and distressed.\" The Holy Prophet ﷺ sent a message to one of his blessed wives, but she replied: \"We do not have anything except water.\" Then he sent a message to his another wife, and she made the same reply. Then to a third one and then to a fourth one until the message went to all the mothers of the faithful, and they all replied that they had nothing besides water. Then he addressed the congregation and asked if any of them would be willing to entertain the guest, in response to which a venerable Ansari said: \"0 Messenger of Allah, I will entertain him.\" So he took him with and asked his wife whether there was anything to eat. She replied: \"Only as much as our children could eat.\" He asked his wife to put the children to sleep and then said: \"Place the food in front of the guest, sit and then get up and put out the lamp. The guest should not feel that we are not eating.\" The guest ate the food. In the morning, the Companion went to the Holy Prophet ﷺ who informed him that Allah was very pleased with the way he handled the situation the previous night.</p><p>Mahdawi narrates a similar incident of Sayyidna Thabit Ibn Qais ؓ ، a venerable Ansari who entertained his guest one night by putting the light off. There is a common statement appended to all these incidents: 'The above verse was revealed in connection with this event.'</p><p>Qushairi cites a story on the authority of Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ﷺ who reports that a person sent the head of a goat as a gift to a venerable personality from among the blessed Companions. He thought that about a Muslim brother that he and his family are more in need of this, so he sent the head to him. When the second venerable Companion received it, he sent it to a third person who in turn sent it to a fourth person. In this way it circulated in seven houses and eventually it returned to the first venerable personality. On this occasion, the verse was revealed. Tha'labi has also recorded this narration on the authority of Sayyidna Anas ؓ .</p><p>It is recorded in Muwaatta' of Imam Malik (رح) on the authority of Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ that a poor person wanted something to eat. She had only one bread, and she was fasting that day. She asked her maid to give him the bread. The maid said that if it was given away, there would be nothing left for her to break her fast in the evening. Sayyidnh ` A'ishah ؓ insisted and gave the bread to the poor person. The maid says: \"It so happened after this that a person, who was not accustomed to send any gift, sent a whole roasted goat which was completely covered with batter on the outside, which is thought to be the best Arab dish.\" Sayyidah ` A'ishah\t ؓ called the maid and said: \"Come, eat this. This is better than that bread of yours.\"</p><p>Nasa'i has recorded that once Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ fell sick and he felt like eating grapes. A bunch of grapes was bought for him for a dirham. Co-incidentally, a poor person came begging. Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ said that the bunch be given to him. One of the Companions furtively followed him, and bought off the bunch from the beggar and gave it back to Sayyidna Ibn ` Umar ؓ ، but the beggar came again and begged, Sayyidna Ibn ` Umar ؓ gave it to him again. Again someone went behind the beggar secretly and bought off the bunch from him for a dirham and gave it to Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ . The beggar wanted to turn up the third time and beg, but the people stopped him. If Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ knew that the bunch is the same one that he gave out in sadaqah, he would never have accepted it and eaten it. He probably thought that someone had brought it for him from the market-place, and therefore he had eaten it.</p><p>Sayyidna Ibn Mubarak reports on the authority of his chain of transmitters that once Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ sent four thousand Dinars in a moneybag to Sayyidna Abu ` Ubaidah ؓ with his servant, with the message that the money was being sent as a gift. He should use it as he deemed fit. The servant was instructed to remain for a while in the house to see what he would do with the money. The servant, accordingly, gave the moneybag to him and waited for a while. Sayyidna Abu 'Ubaidah ؓ took the bag full of money and supplicated for Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ that Allah may reward him and shower his mercy upon him. Instantly, he called his slave-girl and instructed her to give seven Dinars to so-and-so, five Dinars to so-and-so until all four thousand Dinars were distributed then and there.</p><p>The servant came back and narrated the story. Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ filled another moneybag with four thousand Dinars and sent it with the servant to Sayyidna Mu` adh Ibn Jabal ؓ ، with the same message to him and with the same instruction to the servant. The servant followed the instruction. Sayyidna Mu'dh Ibn Jabal ؓ took the bag of money and supplicated to Allah for Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ ، thus: رَحِمَہُ اللہ وَ وَصلہ May Allah shower His mercy upon him and reward him.\" Then he too immediately sat down to distribute the money. He divided the money into many portions and sent them to different houses. His wife was watching all that was happening. She could not hold herself and eventually spoke out: \"By Allah! We too are poor and we should also receive something.\" At that time only two Dinars had remained in the bag, and he gave them to her. The servant saw all this, returned to Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ ، and reported to him all that he saw. He said: \"They are all brothers, and they all have the same disposition.\"</p><p>Sayyidna Hudhaifah ` Adawi ؓ narrates: \"During the battle of Yarmak, I went out in search of my paternal uncle's son [ cousin ] among the martyrs, and took with me some water just in case there was the last breath of life left in him, so I would give him a sip of water. When I reached him, there was the last spark of life left in him. I asked him whether he would like to have a sip of water, and he nodded 'yes'. Just as I was going to pour the water into his mouth, another martyr next to him heaved a sigh. My cousin indicated to give him the water. When I reached him and was about to give him the water, I heard the voice of a third martyr. The second martyr indicated to give the water to the third one. This series of events continued up to seven martyrs. When I reached the seventh martyr to give water, he had already breathed his last. From there I went back to my cousin, he had also met his end.\"</p><p>These are a few events, some of which relate to the Ansar, and others to the Muhajirin. About a number of these incidents, it is said that the verse under comment was revealed regarding them. In fact, there is no contradiction in these narrations, because it is a well-known habit of narrators that if a verse was revealed under a certain circumstance, and a similar incident took place on another occasion, they mention the second incident as a cause of revelation of that verse as well. In fact, all similar incidents can be said to be the cause of revelation of the verse or, at least, included in its purport.</p><p>Disposing of a Possible Doubt</p><p>Here we need to dispose of a possible doubt that might arise from the noble Companions' narratives of self-sacrifice that were recounted above. The Holy Prophet ﷺ has prohibited for a Muslims to give away all his wealth in charity. For instance, it is reported in a Tradition that a person came with a piece of gold, about the size of an egg, so that it may be given in charity. The Holy Prophet ﷺ threw it towards himself and said: Some of you bring all your wealth to be given away in charity, then they become poor and go around begging.\" The question is how and why did the Companions of the Holy Prophet ﷺ give away whatever they had in the incidents cited above despite the prohibition of such an act?</p><p>Answer to this question can be inferred from these very narratives. In fact, people's conditions are different. Accordingly, the rulings differ from condition to condition. The ruling of prohibition applies to those people who, after giving away all their wealth in charity, regret, and cannot endure their poverty but go around begging. But those people who, after giving away all their wealth in charity, do not regret or feel distressed or agitated, they in fact face the situation with calm courage and resolute endurance. For such people, it is permitted to spend all their wealth in Allah's way. Let us take the case of Sayyidna Siddiq Akbar ؓ who donated all his belongings when fund was being collected for a jihad. The stories narrated above belong to this category. Such people trained and developed their families also to face the ordeals of life with the same calm courage and resolute endurance. Therefore, their rights were not usurped or destroyed either. If the wealth were in the control of their families, they too would have done the same thing.</p><p>Muhajirin [ The Refugees ] Reciprocate the Ansars' Self-Sacrifice</p><p>No social activities or self-sacrifice is possible unilaterally. It has to be bilateral. Therefore, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ has urged the Muslims to exchange gifts with each other and thus enhance their mutual love. So likewise, if a Muslim has given a gift to another, he should repay the gift as a gesture of goodwill. If Allah has granted him abundant wealth, then he should use the wealth to reciprocate. Otherwise, supplication should be enough to reciprocate. It is not in keeping with the principles of ethics or good manners to owe a debt of gratitude to people.</p><p>The Ansar displayed a great deal of self-sacrifice in the matter of the Muhajirin. The former made the latter partners in their homes, their shops, their businesses, their land and their agriculture. When Allah gave the Muhajirin affluence, they did not fall short in doing a good turn in return for their favours.</p><p>Qurtubi cites a narration of the two Sahihs on the authority of Sayyidna Anas Ibn Malik ؓ that when the Muhajirin arrived in Madinah from Makkah, they were absolutely empty-handed. The Ansar, on the other hand, had properties and lands, and they shared half-and-half of all their holdings with the Muhajirin. The former gave half of their fruits to the latter annually. Umm Sulaim ؓ the mother of Sayyidna Anas ؓ ، gave a few of her palm trees to the Holy Prophet ﷺ which he granted to Usamah Ibn Zaid's mother, Umm 'Aiman ؓ .</p><p>Imam Zuhri says that Sayyidna Anas Ibn Malik ؓ reports that when the Holy Prophet ﷺ returned successfully from the expedition of Khaibar to Madinah, the Refugees - all of them - calculated all the gifts of the Ansar and returned them. The Holy Prophet ﷺ took back the trees that were granted to 'Umm ` Aiman and returned them to 'Umm Sulaim ؓ and granted trees to 'Umm 'Aiman from his own orchard.</p><p>وَمَن يُوقَ شُحَّ نَفْسِهِ فَأُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ (... And whoever is saved from the greed of his soul, then such people are the successful....59:9) After the mention of the Ansar's selflessness and self-sacrifice, a general rule of law or a universal principle is being laid down in the concluding part of verse [ 9]. The words shuhh [ avarice ] and bukhl [ greed, miserliness ] are near synonyms. The word shuhh, however, yields the sense of intensive greed for money and possessions. Shuhh [ avarice ] and bukhl [ greed, miserliness ] are absolutely forbidden when a person fails to fulfill obligatory rights, which might be Divine rights, such as Zakah, sadaqat-ul-fitr, ` Ushr, oblation and so on, or they might be human rights, such as the maintenance of the family, needy parents and relatives. It is repugnant and reprehensible if shuhh [ avarice ] and bukhl [ greed, miserliness ] prevent one from spending for laudable and rewardable acts. If one does not spend on customary things, it is not shuhh [ avarice ] and bukhl in terms of the sacred laws of Shari` ah.</p><p>Avarice, niggardliness and jealousy are such evil qualities as the Qur'an and Prophetic Traditions have severely denounced. There are glad tidings for those who avoid them. The Ansar have many good qualities, among which is their immunity from avarice and jealousy.Being free of Malice and Jealousy is a sign of one's being in Paradise</p><p>Ibn Kathir, with reference to Imam Ahmad (رح) ، cites the following narration on the authority of Sayyidna Anas ؓ ، who says:</p><p>\"We were sitting with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ when he said, 'A man is about to arrive who is from among the inmates of Paradise'. One of the Ansars arrived, from whose beard dripped fresh water of minor ablution [ wudu ] and in his left hand were his shoes. The same incident occurred the following day. The same person came in front in the same condition. The same incident happened the third day. The same person entered in the condition described above. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ dissolved the assembly, Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Amr Ibn-ul-` As ؓ followed the Ansari [ so as to find out the secret of his being an inmate of Paradise ] and said to him: 'I had a quarrel in some matter and took an oath that I would not go home for three days. If possible, please accommodate me for three days at your home.' He agreed. Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn 'Amr ؓ spent the three nights with him. But he noticed that he did not wake up for 'tahajjud' (voluntary nightly prayers) at night. However, when he lied on bed, he recited some 'dhikr of Allah'. Then he would wake up for Fajr salah. In the course of three days, he did not hear him utter a single word but that of good. ` Abdullah says, 'When three nights were over, and I almost thought his actions were insignificant, I gave up my secret that I had no domestic quarrel. But I continuously heard for three days the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying a man is about to arrive who is from among the inmates of Paradise'. And for three days you arrived. Therefore, I was curious to stay with you and find out your secret act, on account of which you have attained this high status. But strangely enough I did not see you do any extraordinary deed.' Then I asked him: 'What gave you this high status?' He said, 'I have no deed more than what you have seen.' I heard this and was about to return. He called me back and said: '0 Yes, there is something. I do not harbour in my heart any malice or evil against any Muslim, I am not jealous or envious of any Muslim, if Allah has given him anything good.' Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Amr Ibn-ul-` As ؓ said: 'That exactly is the quality that has taken you to the lofty status.'</p><p>Having cited this narration, Ibn Kathir says that Nasa'i has also cited this narration in his ` Amal-ul-Yawm wal-Laylah' and its chain of narrators is authentic according to the standard of Bukhari and Muslim.</p>"

            "text": "На часть военной добычи имели право и ансары, то есть уверовавшие жители Медины. Это - племена аль-Аус и аль-Хазрадж, которые по доброй воле покорились Аллаху и Его посланнику. Они искренне возлюбили Пророка Мухаммада, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, дали ему надежный кров, приняли решение защищать его от любых врагов и превратили свой город в родной дом для уверовавших переселенцев в то время, как все другие земли были очагом войны, язычества и зла. Все, кто стремился помочь религии Аллаха, примыкал к помощникам Аллаха и Его посланника - ансарам. Это продолжалось до тех пор, пока ислам не окреп и не начал распространяться по свету. И тогда мусульмане начали покорять людские сердца знанием, верой и Кораном, а страны - мечами и оружием. Говоря о прекрасных качествах ансаров, Всевышний Аллах подчеркнул, что они возлюбили переселившихся к ним мусульман, потому еще раньше они возлюбили Аллаха и Его посланника, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, и всех, кого любит Аллах и кто помогает Его религии. Они не испытывали никакой тяги к тому, что было отдано мухаджирам, и не завидовали той милости, которой Аллах одарил мухаджиров, и тем достоинствам, которыми Он наделил только их. Все это свидетельствует о том, что ансары были великодушными людьми, а злоба и зависть не находили места в их сердцах. Этот аят свидетельствует о превосходстве мухаджиров над ансарами, во-первых, потому что Аллах упомянул о мухаджирах раньше, а во-вторых, потому что Он сообщил, что ансары не питают зависти к тому, чем одарены мухаджиры. Бесспорно, Всевышний Аллах почтил мухаджиров вознаграждением, которого не получили ни ансары, ни все остальные. И это справедливо, потому что они не только помогали Пророку, но и переселились на пути Аллаха. Однако и ансары не были лишены достоинств, которыми они превзошли других. Одним из этих достоинств было то, что они великодушно отдают своим переселившимся братьям и сестрам предпочтение пред собой, хотя сами находятся в стесненном положении. Если человек отдает предпочтение другому перед собой, то его щедрость и великодушие достигли совершенства. Он готов пожертвовать своим богатством и одарить другого, даже если сам нуждается в нем и даже если находится в стесненном положении. Эти черты присущи только людям с благородным нравом, которые любят Всевышнего Аллаха сильнее, чем собственные страсти и земные удовольствия. Примером этого служит история одного из ансаров, по поводу которого и было ниспослано это откровение. Когда в его доме заночевали гости, он предпочел накормить их, а сам со своей женой и детьми лег спать голодным. Подобному великодушию противоположны корысть и эгоизм. Великодушие - похвально, а корысть и эгоизм заслуживают порицания, потому что являются проявлениями скупости и алчности. Те, кто наделен великодушием, избавлены от алчности, и они непременно обретут успех. Конечно же, речь идет о тех, кто оградил свою душу не только от алчности, но и от других пороков. Если человеку удается избавиться от них, то он смиряется перед повелениями Аллаха и Его посланника, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, и покорно выполняет их. Ему становится чуждо все, что запретил Аллах, даже если душа испытывает к этому тягу и влечение. Он начинает расходовать свое имущество на пути Аллаха, стремясь снискать Его благосклонность и обрести вечное блаженство. Воистину, всего этого лишены те, которые не могут оградить себя от алчности и пороков. Они погрязают в них и скупятся на добрые дела, а ведь именно это является источником всякого зла. Таким образом, в этих аятах Всевышний упомянул о пречистых сподвижниках Пророка - мухаджирах и ансарах. Они были великими имамами мусульманской общины, которые удостоились почестей и наград и опередили всех, кто был до них и кто пришел после них. Благодаря своим делам и своей вере они стали лучшими среди мусульман и первыми среди богобоязненных верующих."

This was the reason why Sayyidna ` Umar Al-Faruq ؓ conquered great territories like ` Iraq, Syria, Egypt and so on, but did not distribute them among the fighters. He retained them as public endowment for next generations, so that the income might accrue to the Islamic public treasury and the Muslims till the Last Hour may benefit from it. When some of the blessed Companions enquired about the distribution of the conquered territories, he referred to this verse and said: Had it not been for the future generations of Muslims, I would have distributed all the conquered territories among the fighters as they were captured, following the example of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ . When Khaibar was conquered, the Holy Prophet ﷺ distributed all its lands. If all the lands are distributed among the present Muslim generation, nothing will be left for future generations.\" [ Transmitted by Malik and Qurtubi ].</p><p>Love for the Blessed Companions ؓ is a sign that the Ummah is on Truth</p><p>On this occasion, Allah has put the Ummah of Muhammad ﷺ into three different categories: [ 1] Muhajirin; [ 2] Ansar; and [ 3] the general body of the Ummah. The special characteristics of the Muhajirin and the sterling qualities of the Ansars are described in the relevant verses above. As for the merits of the rest of the Ummah, the verse merely mentions one quality of theirs that they recognize the high status of Muhajirin and the Ansar in that they had preceded them in faith and were means of communicating it to us. Further, they pray for forgiveness of all, and also pray that their own hearts be completely cleansed of all bitterness and spite towards true and sincere Muslims.</p><p>This shows that for the validity and acceptance of faith and Islam of all the coming generations of Muslims, after the blessed Companions, it is a necessary condition that they have love and respect for the Companions of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، and pray for their brethren in Faith of earlier generations. Where this necessary condition is lacking, such people are not worthy of being called Muslims. Therefore, Sayyidna Mus'ab Ibn Sa'd ؓ says that the Muslims of this Ummah are divided into three categories, of which two categories [ those of Muhajirin and Ansar ] have already been mentioned. The third category remains. If anyone wishes to have a place in the Ummah, he should join the third category by showing love, respect and honour to the blessed Companions.</p><p>Someone approached Sayyidna Husain ؓ and inquired about Sayyidna ` Uthman ؓ [ who had by then been martyred ], the former asked the inquirer: \"Are you one of the Muhajirin?\" He replied: \"No\". Then he asked him: \"Are you one of the Ansar?\" He replied: \"No.\" He then said: 'There remains only the third verse وَالَّذِينَ جَاءُوا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ \"And... those who came after them...[ 59:10] \": If you wish to create doubt about Sayyidna ` Uthman ؓ ، then you will have to leave this category as well.'</p><p>Qurtubi says that this verse is a proof that love of the blessed Companions is obligatory. Sayyidna Imam Malik (رح) says that any person who reviles a Companion or holds a grudge against him, will not have a share in the fai' property of the Muslims. Then he argues, on the basis of this verse, that every Muslim has a share in the fai' property, and anyone who has no share, his faith in Islam is doubtul.</p><p>Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Abbas ؓ has stated that Allah has commanded all Muslims to pray for the Companions of Muhammad ﷺ and for their forgiveness, whereas Allah knew that there would be conflicts and civil wars between them. Therefore, it is not permissible for any Muslim to hold evil thoughts about them on account of their conflicts.</p><p>Sayyidah ` A'shah Siddiqah ؓ says, \"I have heard your Holy Prophet ﷺ say that this community will not perish unless the later generations curse the earlier generations.\"</p><p>Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ says: \"When you hear anyone reviling a Companion, tell him, 'May the curse of Allah be upon the one who is the worst of you'.\" Obviously, no Companion can ever be worse. The one who is cursing would be the worst one. In a word, it is a cause of curse to revile a Companion.</p><p>` Amr Ibn Haushab (رح) says: \"I have found the earlier generations of this Ummah uniformly and strongly advise people to describe the merits of the noble Companions ؓ and their good qualities, so that they may develop love for them. Do not ever talk about their conflicts and disagreements, so that people may become bold and show disrespect to them.\" [ All these narratives have been adapted from Qurtubi ].</p>"

            "text": "Идти путем сподвижников и руководствоваться их примером является честью для всех последующих поколений. Поэтому Всевышний сказал, что последователи мухаджиров и ансаров говорят: «Господи наш! Прости нас и наших братьев, которые уверовали раньше нас!» Эта молитва подчеркивает не только стремление мусульман заслужить прощение, но и их доброе отношение к остальным правоверным. Они молятся за сподвижников Пророка, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, а также за их верующих предшественников и правоверных последователей. В этом состоит одно из превосходств истинной веры: верующие помогают друг другу и молятся друг за друга. Их объединяет вера, которая призывает мусульман питать друг к другу братские чувства. А одним из проявлений мусульманского братства является мольба друг за друга и взаимная любовь. Вот почему мусульмане молят Господа не насаждать в их сердцах ни капли ненависти к их братьям по вере. Когда же этого скверного чувства нет, его место занимает любовь к правоверным, дружба с ними, неподдельная благожелательность к ним и все, что обязан испытывать один верующий к другому. Всевышний назвал мусульман, которые обратились в ислам после сподвижников, верующими. А слова их молитвы свидетельствуют о том, что сподвижников Пророка и их последователей объединяет единая вера и общие воззрения. Этой чести удостаиваются истинные последователи Пророка и сторонники единой общины, потому что никто иной в полной мере не обладает упомянутыми выше качествами. Праведные мусульмане всегда признают свои ошибки и грехи, молят о прощении за себя и за других и просят Аллаха избавить их от ненависти и злобы к своим верующим братьям. Обо всем этом свидетельствуют слова, с которыми они взывают к Аллаху. Воистину, эти слова проникнуты любовью друг к другу. Эта любовь заставляет мусульман желать для своих братьев того же, чего они желают для себя, и питать к ним искренние и нежные чувства, независимо от того, далеко они или близко, живы они или умерли. Этот священный аят учит тому, как правоверные должны соблюдать свои обязанности друг перед другом. Затем Господь подчеркнул, что они заканчивают свою молитву, обращаясь к Аллаху Его прекрасными именами - Сострадательный, Милосердный. Эти два благородных имени Аллаха указывают на совершенство Его милости, сострадания и добродетели по отношению к Его творениям, величайшим проявлением которых является Его помощь Своим рабам в соблюдении ими обязанностей перед Ним и людьми. Таким образом, Всевышний отметил достоинства и качества праведных мусульман - мухаджиров, ансаров и их последователей. Именно они заслужили право на военную добычу, которая целиком и полностью расходуется на благо ислама, и были удостоены многих великих почестей. Господи! По милости Своей и великодушию сделай нас в их числе!"

ورغلانا چاہا لیکن وہ قابو میں نہ آیا اس نے ایک عورت پر اپنا اثر ڈالا اور یہ ظاہر کیا کہ گویا اسے جنات ستا رہے ہیں، ادھر اس عورت کے بھائیوں کو یہ وسوسہ ڈالا کہ اس کا علاج اسی عابد سے ہو سکتا ہے، یہ اس عورت کو اس عابد کے پاس لائے، اس نے علاج معالجہ یعنی دم کرنا شروع کیا اور یہ عورت یہیں رہنے لگی، ایک دن عابد اس کے پاس ہی تھا جو شیطان نے اس کے خیالات خراب کرنے شروع کئے یہاں تک کہ وہ زنا کر بیٹھا اور وہ عورت حاملہ ہو گئی۔ اب رسوائی کے خوف سے شیطان نے چھٹکارے کی یہ صورت بتائی کہ اس عورت کو مار ڈال ورنہ راز کھل جائے گا۔ </p><p> چنانچہ اس نے اسے قتل کر ڈالا، ادھر اس نے جا کر عورت کے بھائیوں کو شک دلوایا وہ دوڑے آئے، شیطان راہب کے پاس آیا اور کہا وہ لوگ آ رہے ہیں اب عزت بھی جائے گی اور جان بھی جائے گی۔ اگر مجھے خوش کر لے اور میرا کہا مان لے تو عزت اور جان دونوں بچ سکتی ہیں۔ شیطان نے کہا مجھے سجدہ کر، عابد نے اسے سجدہ کر لیا، یہ کہنے لگا تف ہے تجھ پر کم بخت میں تو اب تجھ سے بےزار ہوں میں تو اللہ تعالیٰ سے ڈرتا ہوں، جو رب العالمین ہے۔   <span class=\"reference\">[تفسیر ابن جریر

ایک راہب کی خانقاہ تلے رات گزرا کرتی تھی، اس کے چار بھائی تھے، ایک دن شیطان نے راہب کو گدگدایا اور اس سے زنا کر بیٹھا اسے حمل رہ گیا۔ شیطان نے راہب کے دل میں ڈالا کہ اب بڑی رسوائی ہو گی اس سے بہتر یہ ہے کہ اسے مار ڈال اور کہیں دفن کر دے، تیرے تقدس کو دیکھتے ہوئے، تیری طرف تو کسی کا خیال بھی نہ جائے گا اور اگر بالفرض پھر بھی کچھ پوچھ گچھ ہو تو جھوٹ موٹ کہ دینا، بھلا کون ہے جو تیری بات کو غلط جانے؟ اس کی سمجھ میں بھی یہ بات آ گئی، ایک روز رات کے وقت موقعہ پا کر اس عورت کو جان سے مار ڈالا اور کسی اجاڑ جگہ زمین میں دبا دیا۔ اب شیطان اس کے چاروں بھائیوں کے پاس پہنچا اور ہر ایک کے خواب میں اسے سارا واقعہ کہہ سنایا اور اس کے دفن کی جگہ بھی بتا دی، صبح جب یہ جاگے تو ایک نے کہا: آج کی رات تو میں نے ایک عجیب خواب دیکھا ہے ہمت نہیں پڑتی کہ آپ سے بیان کروں دوسروں نے کہا: نہیں کہو تو سہی چنانچہ اس نے اپنا پورا خواب بیان کیا کہ اس طرح فلاں عابد نے اس سے بدکاری کی پھر جب حمل ٹھہر گیا تو اسے قتل کر دیا اور فلاں جگہ اس کی لاش دبا آیا ہے، ان تینوں میں سے ہر ایک نے کہا مجھے بھی یہی خواب آیا ہے، اب تو انہیں یقین ہو گیا کہ سچا خواب ہے، چنانچہ انہوں نے جا کر اطلاع دی اور بادشاہ کے حکم سے اس راہب کو اس خانقاہ سے ساتھ لیا اور اس جگہ پہنچ کر زمین کھود کر اس کی لاش برآمد کی۔ </p><p> کامل ثبوت کے بعد اب اسے شاہی دربار میں لے چلے اس وقت شیطان اس کے سامنے ظاہر ہوتا ہے اور کہتا ہے یہ سب میرے کرتوت ہیں اب بھی اگر تو مجھے راضی کر لے تو جان بچا دوں گا اس نے کہا جو تو کہے کروں گا، کہا مجھے سجدہ کر لے، اس نے یہ بھی کر دیا، پس پورا بے ایمان بنا کر شیطان کہتا ہے، میں تو تجھ سے بری ہوں، میں تو اللہ تعالیٰ سے جو تمام جہانوں کا رب ہے ڈرتا ہوں، چنانچہ بادشاہ نے حکم دیا اور پادری صاحب کو قتل کر دیا گیا، مشہور ہے کہ اس پادری کا نام برصیصا تھا۔ سیدنا علی، سیدنا عبداللہ بن مسعود رضی اللہ عنہم، طاؤس، مقاتل بن حیان رحمہ اللہ علیہم وغیرہ سے یہ قصہ مختلف الفاظ سے کمی بیشی کے ساتھ مروی ہے۔ <span class=\"arabic

دعا کی پھر اس بچے سے پوچھا: اے بچے بتا تیرا باپ کون ہے؟ اس بچے کو اللہ نے اپنے ولی کی عزت بچانے کے لیے اپنی قدرت سے گویائی کی قوت عطا فرما دی اور اس نے اس صاف فصیح زبان میں اونچی آواز سے کہا میرا باپ

Also, what they said they would do, would never have been fulfilled by them, and this is why Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَئِن قُوتِلُواْ لاَ يَنصُرُونَهُمْ</div><p>(and if they are attacked, they will never help them.) meaning, the hypocrites will not fight along with the Jews,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَئِن نَّصَرُوهُمْ</div><p>(And (even) if they do help them, ) and even if the hypocrites did fight along their side,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَيُوَلُّنَّ الاٌّدْبَـرَ ثُمَّ لاَ يُنصَرُونَ</div><p>(they will turn their backs, and they will not be victorious.)

Allah then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يُقَـتِلُونَكُمْ جَمِيعاً إِلاَّ فِى قُرًى مُّحَصَّنَةٍ أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ جُدُرٍ</div><p>(They fight not against you even together, except in fortified townships, or from behind walls.) meaning, they will not fight Muslims except from behind besieged fortified forts, because of their cowardice and fear of Muslims. They only fight when they have to defend themselves (even though they threaten Muslims of reprisals). Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَأْسُهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ شَدِيدٌ</div><p>(Their enmity among themselves is very great.) meaning, the enmity they feel against each other is intense,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُذِيقَ بَعْضَكُمْ بَأْسَ بَعْضٍ</div><p>(And make you to taste the violence of one another.)(6:65) Allah said in the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَحْسَبُهُمْ جَمِيعاً وَقُلُوبُهُمْ شَتَّى</div><p>(You would think they were united, but their hearts are divided.) meaning, even though one might see them combining forces and think that these forces are harmonious, yet in reality, they are divided severely. Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said that this Ayah refers to the hypocrites and the People of the Scriptures,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يَعْقِلُونَ</div><p>(That is because they are a people who understand not.) Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَمَثَلِ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ قَرِيباً ذَاقُواْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ </div><p>(They are like their immediate predecessors; they tasted the evil result of their conduct, and for them a painful torment.) referring to the Jewish tribe of Bani Qaynuqa`, according to Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and Muhammad bin Ishaq.</p><h2>The Parable of the Hypocrites and the Jews</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَمَثَلِ الشَّيْطَـنِ إِذْ قَالَ لِلإِنسَـنِ اكْفُرْ فَلَمَّا كَفَرَ قَالَ إِنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّنكَ</div><p>(Like Shaytan, when he says to man: \"Disbelieve.\" But when (man) disbelieves, Shaytan says: \"I am free of you...\") meaning, the example of the Jews being deceived by the promises of the hypocrites, who said that they will help them if Muslims fight them, is that of the devil. When matters got serious and the Jews were besieged, the hypocrites betrayed them and abandoned them to taste utter defeat. Likewise, the devil lures mankind into disbelief and when they obey him, he disowns them and declares himself free of their actions, saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى أَخَافُ اللَّهَ رَبَّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</div><p>(I fear Allah, the Lord of all that exists!)

এদের অন্তরে আল্লাহর ভয় অপেক্ষা তোমাদেরই ভয় বেশী আছে। যেমন আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা অন্য জায়গায় বলেনঃ (আরবী) অর্থাৎ তাদের একটি দল আল্লাহর ভয়ের মত মানুষকে ভয় করে অথবা আরো বেশী ভয় (অর্থাৎ আল্লাহকে ভয় করার চেয়েও বেশী মানুষকে ভয় করে)।” (৪:৭৭)এ জন্যেই এখানে আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা বলেনঃ এটা এই জন্যে যে, এরা এক নির্বোধ সম্প্রদায়।তাদের ভীরুতা ও কাপুরুষতার অবস্থা এই যে, তারা মুসলমানদের সাথে। সামনা-সামনি কখনো যুদ্ধ করার সাহস রাখে না। হ্যাঁ, যদি সুরক্ষিত দূর্গের মধ্যে বসে থেকে কিংবা মরিচার (পরিখার) মধ্যে লুকিয়ে থেকে কিছু করার সুযোগে পায় তবে তারা ঐ সুযোগের সদ্ব্যবহার করবে। কিন্তু যুদ্ধক্ষেত্রে অবতীর্ণ হয়ে বীরত্ব প্রদর্শন করা তাদের জন্যে সুদূর পরাহত। তারা পরস্পরই একে অপরের শত্রু। তাদের পরস্পরের মধ্যে কঠিন শক্রতা বিদ্যমান। যেমন আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা বলেনঃ(আরবী) অর্থাৎ “তোমাদের কাউকেও তিনি কারো যুদ্ধের স্বাদ আস্বাদন করিয়ে থাকেন।” (৬:৬৫)মহামহিমান্বিত আল্লাহ্ বলেনঃ হে নবী (সঃ)! তুমি মনে কর যে, তারা ঐক্যবদ্ধ, কিন্তু প্রকৃতপক্ষে তারা ঐক্যবদ্ধ নয়, বরং বিচ্ছিন্ন। তাদের মনের মিল নেই। মুনাফিকরা এক জায়গায় রয়েছে এবং কিতাবীরা অন্য জায়গায় রয়েছে। তারা একে অপরের শক্র। কারণ এই যে, এরা এক নির্বোধ সম্প্রদায়।  মহান আল্লাহ বলেনঃ এদের তুলনা— এদের অব্যবহিত পূর্বে যারা নিজেদের কৃতকর্মের শাস্তি আস্বাদন করেছে তারা। এর দ্বারা উদ্দেশ্য কুরায়েশ কাফিররাও হতে পারে যে, বদরের যুদ্ধের দিন তাদের ষড়যন্ত্র ব্যর্থ হয় এবং তারা চরম ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হয়। অথবা এর দ্বারা ইয়াহদী বানী কাইনুকাকে বুঝানো হয়েছে। তারাও দুষ্কর্যে ও ঘৃণ্য ষড়যন্ত্রে লিপ্ত হয়েছিল। আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা স্বীয় নবী (সঃ)-কে তাদের উপর জয়যুক্ত করেন। নবী (সঃ) তাদেরকে মদীনা হতে বিতাড়িত করেন। এ দুটিই নিকট অতীতের ঘটনা। এতে এদের জন্যে উপদেশ ও শিক্ষা রয়েছে। তবে এখানে বানী কাইনুকার ঘটনাটি উদ্দেশ্য হওয়াই অধিকতর যুক্তিসঙ্গত। কেননা, এর পূর্বেই রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বানী কাইনুকা নামক ইয়াহূদী গোত্রটিকে নির্বাসিত করেছিলেন। এসব ব্যাপারে আল্লাহ্ তা'আলাই সবচেয়ে ভাল জানেন।  আল্লাহ্ তা'আলার উক্তিঃ এদের (মুনাফিকদের) তুলনা শয়তান- যে মানুষকে বলেঃ কুফরী কর, অতঃপর যখন সে কুফরী করে তখন শয়তান বলেঃ ‘তোমার সাথে আমার কোন সম্পর্ক নেই। অর্থাৎ মুনাফিকদের অঙ্গীকারের ভিত্তিতে এই ইয়াহূদীদের মুসলমানদের বিরুদ্ধে উত্তেজিত হওয়া ও তাদের সাথে কৃত চুক্তি ভঙ্গ করা, অতঃপর সুযোগেমত এই মুনাফিকদের ঐ ইয়াহূদীদের কাজে না আসা, যুদ্ধের সময় তাদেরকে সাহায্য না করা এবং তাদের নির্বাসনের সময় ঐ মুনাফিকদের তাদের সঙ্গী না হওয়া, একটি দৃষ্টান্তের দ্বারা আল্লাহ্ তাবারাকা ওয়া তা'আলা বুঝাচ্ছেনঃ দেখো, শয়তান এই ভাবেই মানুষকে কুফরী করতে উত্তেজিত করে। অতঃপর যখন সে কুফরী করে বসে তখন সে নিজেই তাকে তিরস্কার করতে শুরু করে এবং নিজেকে আল্লাহ্ ওয়ালা বলে প্রকাশ করে। ঐ সময় সে বলেঃ নিশ্চয়ই আমি জগতসমূহের প্রতিপালক আল্লাহরকে ভয় করি।এখানে এই দৃষ্টান্তের সাথে সামঞ্জস্যপূর্ণ বানী ইসরাঈলের একজন আবেদের একটি ঘটনা বর্ণনা করা হয়েছে। হযরত আবদুল্লাহ্ ইবনে নাহীক (রাঃ) হযরত আলী (রাঃ)-কে বলতে শুনেছেন যে, বানী ইসরাঈলের মধ্যে একজন আবেদ ছিলেন। তিনি ষাট বছর আল্লাহ্ তা'আলার ইবাদতে কাটিয়ে দিয়েছিলেন। শয়তান তাকে বিভ্রান্ত করার চেষ্টা করে। কিন্তু তার সব চেষ্টাই ব্যর্থ হয়। অবশেষে সে একজন মহিলার মাধ্যমে উদ্দেশ্য সিদ্ধির চেষ্টা করে। সে তার উপর এমনভাবে প্রভাব বিস্তার করে যে, তাকে যেন জ্বিনে ধরেছে এই লক্ষণ প্রকাশ পায়। এদিকে ঐ মহিলাটির ভাইদেরকে সে এই কুমন্ত্রণা দেয় যে, ঐ আবেদের কাছেই এর চিকিৎসা হতে পারে। তারা মহিলাটিকে ঐ আবেদের কাছে নিয়ে গেল। আবেদ লোকটি তখন তার চিকিৎসা অর্থাৎ ঝাড়-ফুক, দু'আ-তাবী ইত্যাদি শুরু করে দিলেন। মহিলাটি তার ওখানেই থাকতে লাগলো। একদিন আবেদ মহিলাটির পার্শ্বেই ছিলেন এমন সময় শয়তান তার মনে কুচিন্তার উদ্রেক করলো। শেষ পর্যন্ত তিনি মহিলাটির সাথে ব্যভিচার করে বসলেন। মহিলাটি গর্ভবতী হয়ে গেল। এখন এই লজ্জা নিবারণের পন্থা ঐ শয়তান এই বাতলিয়ে দিলো যে, তিনি যেন মহিলাটিকে মেরে ফেলেন, অন্যথায় রহস্য খুলে যাবে। সুতরাং ঐ আবেদ মহিলাটিকে হত্যা করে ফেললেন। ওদিকে শয়তান মহিলাটির ভাইদের মনে আবেদের উপর সন্দেহ জাগিয়ে তুললো। তারা আবেদের আশ্রমের দিকে অগ্রসর হলো। এদিকে শয়তান আবেদের কাছে এসে বললোঃ “মহিলাটির লোকেরা আপনার কাছে আসছে। এখন আপনার মান-সম্মানও যাবে এবং প্রাণও যাবে। সুতরাং এখন যদি আপনি আমাকে সন্তুষ্ট করেন এবং আমি যা বলি তা মেনে নেন তবে আপনার মান-সম্মান ও প্রাণ বেঁচে যেতে পারে।” আবেদ বললেনঃ “ঠিক আছে, তুমি যা বলবে আমি তাই করতে প্রস্তুত আছি।” শয়তান তখন বললোঃ “আমাকে সিজদাহ্ করুন!” তিনি সিজদাহ্ করলেন। শয়তান তখন বললোঃ “হে হতভাগ্য! ধিক্ আপনাকে। আপনার সাথে আমার কোনই সম্পর্ক নেই। আমি বিশ্ব প্রতিপালক আল্লাহকে ভয় করি।” (এ ঘটনাটি ইমাম ইবনে জারীর (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন) অন্য একটি রিওয়াইয়াতে আছে যে, একটি স্ত্রীলোক বকরী চরাতো এবং একজন পাদরীর আশ্রমের নীচে রাত্রি যাপন করতো। তার চারটি ভাই ছিল। একদিন শয়তানের প্ররোচনায় পড়ে পাদরী ঐ স্ত্রীলোকটির সাথে ব্যভিচার করে বসলেন। স্ত্রী লোকটি গর্ভবতী হয়ে গেল। শয়তান পাদরীর কাছে এসে বললোঃ “এটা তো বড়ই লজ্জার কথা। সুতরাং উত্তম পন্থা এটাই যে, মহিলাটিকে হত্যা করে কোন জায়গায় পুঁতে ফেলুন। আপনার সম্পর্কে মানুষের মনে কোন ধারণাই আসবে না। কেননা, আপনার পবিত্রতা সম্বন্ধে তারা পূর্ণ ওয়াকিফহাল। আর যদি আপনাকে এ সম্পর্কে জিজ্ঞাসাবাদ করাও হয় তবে মিথ্যা কিছু একটা বলে দিবেন। কে এমন আছে যে, আপনার কথা বিশ্বাস করবে না?” এক রাত্রে সুযোগে পেয়ে শয়তানের কথামত তিনি মহিলাটিকে হত্যা করে দিলেন এবং এক জন-মানব হীন জঙ্গলে পুঁতে ফেললেন। তখন শয়তান মহিলাটির চার ভাই এর নিকট গমন করলো এবং স্বপ্নে প্রত্যেককে ঘটনাটি শুনিয়ে দিলো। তাকে পুঁতে ফেলার জায়গাটির কথাও বলে দিলো। সকালে জেগে ওঠে তাদের একজন বললোঃ “আজ রাত্রে আমি এক বিস্ময়কর স্বপ্ন দেখেছি। কিন্তু আমার সাহস হয় না যে, আপনাদের সামনে এটা বর্ণনা করি!” তার ভাইয়েরা বললোঃ “না, অবশ্যই তোমাকে বলতে হবে।” তখন সে বলতে শুরু করলো যে, এই ভাবে অমুক আবেদ তাদের বোনের সাথে কুকাজ করেছিল। ফলে সে গর্ভবতী হয়েছিল, তাই সে তাকে হত্যা করেছে এবং অমুক জায়গায় তার মৃতদেহ পুঁতে রেখেছে। তার এ স্বপ্নের কথা শুনে ঐ তিন ভাইয়ের প্রত্যেকে বললোঃ “আমিও এই স্বপ্নই দেখেছি।” এখন সবারই দৃঢ় বিশ্বাস জন্মে গেল যে, এ স্বপ্ন সত্য। সুতরাং তারা এ খবর সরকারকে দিয়ে দিলো। বাদশাহর হুকুমে আবেদকে পাকড়াও করা হলো এবং যে জায়গায় সে মহিলাটির মৃতদেহ পুঁতে রেখেছিল সেখানে যাওয়া হলো। তারপর ঐ জায়গা খনন করিয়ে মৃতদেহ উদ্ধার করা হলো। পূর্ণ প্রমাণের পর ঐ পাদরীকে শাহী দরবারে নিয়ে যাওয়া হলো। ঐ সময় শয়তান তার সামনে প্রকাশিত হয়ে বললোঃ “এসব আমিই করিয়েছি। এখনও যদি আপনি আমাকে সন্তুষ্ট করেন তবে আমি আপনার প্রাণ রক্ষা করতে পারি।” আবেদ বললোঃ “বল, কি বলবে?” উত্তরে শয়তান বললোঃ “আমাকে সিজদাহ্ করুন।” আবেদ তাকে সিজদাহ্ও করলো। এভাবে তাকে পূর্ণ বে-ঈমান বানিয়ে নিয়ে শয়তান তাকে বললোঃ “আপনার সাথে আমার কোনই সম্পর্ক নেই। আমি তো বিশ্বজগতের প্রতিপালক আল্লাহকে ভয় করি।” অতঃপর বাদশাহর নির্দেশক্রমে পাদরীকে হত্যা করে দেয়া হলো।এটা প্রসিদ্ধ হয়ে আছে যে, ঐ পাদরীর নাম ছিল বারসীমা। হযরত আলী (রাঃ), হযরত আবদুল্লাহ ইবনে মাসউদ (রাঃ), হযরত তাউস (রাঃ), হযরত মুকাতিল ইবনে হাইয়ান (রঃ) প্রমুখ গুরুজন হতে এ ঘটনাটি বিভিন্ন শব্দে কিছু কম-বেশীর সাথে বর্ণিত আছে। এসব ব্যাপারে আল্লাহ্ তা'আলাই সবচেয়ে ভাল জানেন।এরই সম্পূর্ণ বিপরীত হলো হযরত জুরায়েজ (রঃ) নামক আবেদের ঘটনাটি। একজন ব্যভিচারিণী মহিলা তার উপর অপবাদ দেয় যে, তিনি তার সাথে ব্যভিচার করেছেন এবং এরই ফলে তার শিশুটি জন্মগ্রহণ করেছে। তার এই কথার উপর বিশ্বাস করে জনগণ তাঁর ইবাদতখানাটি ঘিরে নেয় এবং গালি দিতে দিতে অত্যন্ত বে-আদবীর সাথে তাঁকে তাঁর ইবাদতখানা হতে বের করে আনে। তারা তাঁর ইবাদতখানাটি ভেঙ্গে ফেলে। এই বেচারা হতবুদ্ধি হয়ে তাদেরকে বার বার বলতে থাকেনঃ “বল, ঘটনাটি কি?” কিন্তু কেউই তাঁর কথায় কর্ণপাত করলো না। অবশেষে তাদের একজন বললোঃ “ওরে ভণ্ড তাপস! তাপসের পোশাক পরে ভণ্ডামী করছো? তোমার দ্বারা এই শয়তানী কাজ সংঘটিত হলো? এই মহিলাটির সাথে তুমি ব্যভিচারে লিপ্ত হলে!” হযরত জুরায়েজ (রঃ) তখন বললেনঃ “আচ্ছা, থামো, ধৈর্য ধর। ঐ শিশুটিকে নিয়ে এসো।” অতঃপর দুধের ঐ শিশুটিকে নিয়ে আসা হলো। হযরত জুরায়েজ (রঃ) নিজের ইজ্জত রক্ষার জন্যে মহান আল্লাহর নিকট প্রার্থনা করলেন। অতঃপর তিনি ঐ শিশুটিকে জিজ্ঞেস করলেনঃ “হে শিশু! বলতো, তোমার পিতা কে?” নিজের ওলীর ইজ্জত রক্ষার্থে আল্লাহ্ রাব্বল আলামীন ঐ অবলা শিশুকে বাকশক্তি দান করলেন। সুতরাং শিশুটি সুন্দর ভাষায় উচ্চকণ্ঠে বলে উঠলোঃ “আমার পিতা হলো এক রাখাল।” শিশুর মুখে একথা শুনে তো বানী ইসরাঈলের লজ্জার কোন সীমা থাকলো না। ঐ বুযুর্গ ব্যক্তির সামনে তারা করজোড়ে ক্ষমা প্রার্থনা করলো। তখন তিনি বললেনঃ “আচ্ছা, ঠিক আছে। এখন তোমরা আমাকে ছেড়ে দাও।” জনগণ তাঁকে বললোঃ “আমরা সোনা দ্বারা আপনার ইবাদতখানাটি বানিয়ে দিচ্ছি।” তিনি উত্তরে বললেনঃ “না, বরং যেমন ছিল তেমনই বানিয়ে দাও।”এরপর মহাপ্রতাপান্বিত আল্লাহ্ বলেনঃ ফলে কুফরীকারী ও কুফরীর হুকুমদাতা উভয়ের পরিণাম হবে জাহান্নাম। সেখানে তারা স্থায়ী হবে আর যালিমদের কর্মফল এটাই।</p>"

According to Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Abbas ؓ it refers to Banu Qainuqa', a Jewish tribe, who were punished for their mischief and machinations after Badr. Banu Nadir were banished after the battles of Badr and 'Uhud, and Banu Qainuqa' had been banished after Badr. At Badr seventy thousand pagan Arabs were killed, and the survivors returned home disgracefully. Since pagans of Makkah and Banu qainuqa', both of them faced a deterrent punishment after Badr, both can be the purport of the words, who were before them in the past, and of: ذَاقُوا وَبَالَ أَمْرِ‌هِمْ...tasted the evil consequence of their conduct...[ 59:15] \"</p><p>The Expulsion of Banu Qainuqa'</p><p>As stated earlier, when the Holy Prophet migrated from Makkah and settled in Madinah, he concluded a peace treaty with the Jewish tribes of Madinah, and of its neighbourhood. One of its conditions stipulated that they would not fight the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and the Muslims, or assist their enemies. Banu Qainuqa' was a party to this peace agreement and was the first one to break the pledged word, within a few months. On the occasion of the battle of Badr, they connived with the Quraish of Makkah, and some incidents of their connivance came out in the open. On that occasion, the following verse was revealed وَإِمَّا تَخَافَنَّ مِن قَوْمٍ خِيَانَةً فَانبِذْ إِلَيْهِمْ عَلَىٰ سَوَاءٍ (And if you apprehend a breach from a people, then, throw [ the treaty ] towards them being right forward...[ 8:58] \". Banu Qainuqa`, through their treachery, had already broken the treaty. Therefore, The Holy Prophet ﷺ declared war against them and the banner of jihad was given in the hands of Sayyidna Hamzah ؓ and appointing Sayyidna Abu Lubabah ؓ his deputy in the city of Madinah, the Holy Prophet ﷺ himself joined the fighting force. Having seeing the Muslim army, the Jews shut themselves up in the fortress. The Holy Prophet ﷺ laid a siege to it for fifteen days, and the Jews had no choice but to surrender. Eventually, Allah cast terror into their hearts and they realized that fighting would not pay off. So, they opened the gate of the fortress and expressed their willingness to abide by the decision of the Holy Prophet ﷺ .</p><p>The Holy Prophet's ﷺ decision was to have the Jewish men executed. But ` Abdullah Ibn 'Ubayy, the hypocrite, intervened and pleaded to the Holy Prophet ﷺ to pardon them. In the end, it was decided that they should leave the area and go into exile and their belongings would be the spoils falling to the lot of the Muslims. Accordingly, they left Madinah and proceeded to settle in an area called Adhra` at in Syria. In compliance with the law of spoils, one-fifth was retained for Bait-ul-mal [ public treasury ] and the rest of the spoils was disbursed among the fighters. After the battle of Badr, this was the first one-fifth of the booties that was retained for the public treasury. This incident took place on Monday, 15th Shawwal, in the 2nd year of Hijrah - twenty months after the migration.</p>"

But when the Muslims besieged them, not a single hypocrite came forward to assist. The Qur'an here uses a simile to illustrate the similarity between a hypocrite and the Shaitan. The Shaitan incited man to disbelieve and promised him the world, but when he was seriously involved in disbelief, he said that he has nothing to do with him. Only Allah knows how many such episodes the devil must have been involved in, textually, however, we find one such episode narrated in the Qur'an in Surah Anfal, verse [ 48]:</p><p>وَإِذْ زَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ وَقَالَ لَا غَالِبَ لَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ مِنَ النَّاسِ وَإِنِّي جَارٌ‌ لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَمَّا تَرَ‌اءَتِ الْفِئَتَانِ نَكَصَ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيْهِ وَقَالَ إِنِّي بَرِ‌يءٌ مِّنكُمْ إِنِّي أَرَ‌ىٰ مَا لَا تَرَ‌وْنَ إِنِّي أَخَافُ اللَّـهَ ۚ وَاللَّـهُ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</p><p>\"And when the Shaitan beautified their deeds for them and said, 'None of the people is to overpower you today, and I am a protector for you.' But, when the two groups saw each other, he turned back on his heels and said, 'I have nothing to do with you. I am seeing what you do not see. I am scared of Allah, and Allah is severe in punishment.'</p><p>This incident occurred on the occasion of the battle of Badr when the Shaitan misled the pagan Quraish, urged them to wage a war against Muslims, and then he withdrew, and left them in the lurch when they were in the middle of a pitched-battle. It is not clear how the Shaitan did all this, whether he cast suggestions into their minds or whether he came to them in human shape and spoke to them face to face. A full explanation is available in Volume [ 4] of Ma’ ariful Qur’ an, pages 242-247.</p><p>If the verse refers to this incident, in which the Shaitan provokes man to disbelieve and when he does that, he washes his hands of them, it does not seem that the Shaitan asked them to commit kufr, because they were already kafirs. He asked them to be firm in opposing the Messenger ﷺ . The answer is all too obvious, in that it is all the same whether he asked them to commit kufr, or bids them to remain firm in their kufr or fight the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ، because it is also tantamount to kufr.</p><p>Tafsir Mazhari, Qurtubi, Ibn Kathir and others have cited several incidents where monks and devotees were deceived into kufr. For example, one of the Israeli monks devoted himself to Allah in his synagogue, and fasted consecutively and broke his fast only once in ten days. In this way, he spent seventy years of his life. The accursed Shaitan pursued him. He sent after him the most cunning devil in the shape of a monk, a devotee of God. He went up to him and exerted himself in the worship of God and thus built up confidence in the genuine monk. Eventually, the impostor succeeded in teaching the monk a few of the prayers that are efficacious in curing the sickly people. Then the former exerted his influence on many people to fall sick, and gave them the monk's address. When the latter recited the prayers, the devil would remove his influence and thus they would feel cured. He kept up this process for a long period of time, until one day he performed his exertion on the beautiful daughter of an Israeli leader. He sent her also to the monk. He succeeded in getting her into his synagogue and gradually he succeeded in getting him to commit fornication with the girl who, as a result, fell pregnant. He suggested that the girl be killed to save face. After the killing, the devil himself went around telling the story of the killing and put up the people against the monk. They, in their fury, demolished the synagogue and decided to kill him and crucify him. Then the Shaitan went back to the monk and said to him that there is no way out to save his life. 'Of course', he said to him, 'there is one way of saving your life, in that you prostrate to me and I will save your life.' The monk had already committed all the sins. The way to commit kufr was paved. So, he prostrated. At that juncture, the Shaitan said to him plainly, 'You were not falling into my trap. I adopted all these guiles for you to commit kufr. I cannot assist you in any way.' This story is recounted fully in Tafsir Mazhari and Qurtubi. Allah, the Pure and Exalted, knows best!</p>"

واقعها ، فما تجد مثلها ثم تتوب بعد ذلك . فلم يزل به حتى واقعها فحملت وظهر حملها . فقال له الشيطان : ويحك ! قد افتضحت . فهل لك أن تقتلها ثم تتوب فلا تفتضح ، فإن جاءوك وسألوك فقل جاءها شيطانها فذهب بها . فقتلها برصيصا ودفنها ليلا ; فأخذ الشيطان طرف ثوبها حتى بقي خارجا من التراب ; ورجع برصيصا إلى صلاته . ثم جاء الشيطان إلى إخوتها في المنام فقال : إن برصيصا فعل بأختكم كذا وكذا ، وقتلها ودفنها في جبل كذا وكذا ; فاستعظموا [ ص: 36 ] ذلك وقالوا لبرصيصا : ما فعلت أختنا ؟ فقال : ذهب بها شيطانها ; فصدقوه وانصرفوا . ثم جاءهم الشيطان في المنام وقال : إنها مدفونة في موضع كذا وكذا ، وإن طرف ردائها خارج من التراب ; فانطلقوا فوجدوها ، فهدموا صومعته وأنزلوه وخنقوه ، وحملوه إلى الملك فأقر على نفسه فأمر بقتله . فلما صلب قال الشيطان : أتعرفني ؟ قال : لا والله ، قال : أنا صاحبك الذي علمتك الدعوات ، أما اتقيت الله أما استحيت وأنت أعبد بني إسرائيل ثم لم يكفك صنيعك حتى فضحت نفسك ، وأقررت عليها وفضحت أشباهك من الناس ، فإن مت على هذه الحالة لم يفلح أحد من نظرائك بعدك . فقال : كيف أصنع ؟ قال : تطيعني في خصلة واحدة وأنجيك منهم وآخذ بأعينهم . قال : وما ذاك ؟ قال : تسجد لي سجدة واحدة ; فقال : أنا أفعل ; فسجد له من دون الله . فقال : يا برصيصا ، هذا أردت منك ; كان عاقبة أمرك أن كفرت بربك ، إني بريء منك ، إني أخاف الله رب العالمين . وقال وهب بن منبه : إن عابدا كان في بني إسرائيل ، وكان من أعبد أهل زمانه ، وكان في زمانه ثلاثة إخوة لهم أخت ، وكانت بكرا ، ليست لهم أخت غيرها ، فخرج البعث على ثلاثتهم ، فلم يدروا عند من يخلفون أختهم ، ولا عند من يأمنون عليها ، ولا عند من يضعونها . قال : فاجتمع رأيهم على أن يخلفوها عند عابد بني إسرائيل ، وكان ثقة في أنفسهم ، فأتوه فسألوه أن يخلفوها عنده ، فتكون في كنفه وجواره إلى أن يقفلوا من غزاتهم ، فأبى ذلك عليهم وتعوذ بالله منهم ومن أختهم . قال : فلم يزالوا به حتى أطاعهم ، فقال : أنزلوها في بيت حذاء صومعتي ، فأنزلوها في ذلك البيت ثم انطلقوا وتركوها ، فمكثت في جوار ذلك العابد زمانا ، ينزل إليها الطعام من صومعته ، فيضعه عند باب الصومعة ، ثم يغلق بابه ويصعد في صومعته ، ثم يأمرها فتخرج من بيتها فتأخذ ما وضع لها من الطعام . قال : فتلطف له الشيطان فلم يزل يرغبه في الخير ، ويعظم عليه خروج الجارية من بيتها نهارا ، ويخوفه أن يراها أحد فيعلقها . قال : فلبث بذلك زمانا ، ثم جاءه إبليس فرغبه في الخير والأجر ، وقال له : لو كنت تمشي إليها بطعامها حتى تضعه في بيتها كان أعظم لأجرك ; قال : فلم يزل به حتى مشى إليها بطعامها فوضعه في بيتها ، قال : فلبث بذلك زمانا ثم جاءه إبليس فرغبه في الخير وحضه عليه ، وقال : لو كنت تكلمها وتحدثها فتأنس بحديثك ، فإنها قد استوحشت وحشة شديدة . قال : فلم يزل به حتى حدثها زمانا يطلع عليها من فوق صومعته . قال : ثم أتاه إبليس بعد ذلك فقال : لو كنت تنزل إليها فتقعد على باب صومعتك وتحدثها [ ص: 37 ] وتقعد على باب بيتها فتحدثك كان آنس لها . فلم يزل به حتى أنزله وأجلسه على باب صومعته يحدثها ، وتخرج الجارية من بيتها ، فلبثا زمانا يتحدثان ، ثم جاءه إبليس فرغبه في الخير والثواب فيما يصنع بها ، وقال : لو خرجت من باب صومعتك فجلست قريبا من باب بيتها كان آنس لها . فلم يزل به حتى فعل . قال : فلبثا زمانا ، ثم جاءه إبليس فرغبه في الخير وفيما له من حسن الثواب فيما يصنع بها ، وقال له : لو دنوت من باب بيتها فحدثتها ولم تخرج من بيتها ، ففعل . فكان ينزل من صومعته فيقعد على باب بيتها فيحدثها . فلبثا بذلك حينا ثم جاءه إبليس فقال : لو دخلت البيت معها تحدثها ولم تتركها تبرز وجهها لأحد كان أحسن بك . فلم يزل به حتى دخل البيت ، فجعل يحدثها نهاره كله ، فإذا أمسى صعد في صومعته . قال : ثم أتاه إبليس بعد ذلك ، فلم يزل يزينها له حتى ضرب العابد على فخذها وقبلها . فلم يزل به إبليس يحسنها في عينه ويسول له حتى وقع عليها فأحبلها ، فولدت له غلاما ، فجاءه إبليس فقال له : أرأيت إن جاء إخوة هذه الجارية وقد ولدت منك ! كيف تصنع ! لا آمن عليك أن تفتضح أو يفضحوك ! فاعمد إلى ابنها فاذبحه وادفنه ، فإنها ستكتم عليك مخافة إخوتها أن يطلعوا على ما صنعت بها ، ففعل . فقال له : أتراها تكتم إخوتها ما صنعت بها وقتلت ابنها ! خذها فاذبحها وادفنها مع ابنها . فلم يزل به حتى ذبحها وألقاها في الحفيرة مع ابنها ، وأطبق عليها صخرة عظيمة ، وسوى عليها التراب ، وصعد في صومعته يتعبد فيها ; فمكث بذلك ما شاء الله أن يمكث ; حتى قفل إخوتها من الغزو ، فجاءوه فسألوه عنها فنعاها لهم وترحم عليها ، وبكى لهم وقال : كانت خير أمة ، وهذا قبرها فانظروا إليه . فأتى إخوتها القبر فبكوا على قبرها وترحموا عليها ، وأقاموا على قبرها أياما ثم انصرفوا إلى أهاليهم . فلما جن عليهم الليل وأخذوا مضاجعهم ، أتاهم الشيطان في صورة رجل مسافر ، فبدأ بأكبرهم فسأله عن أختهم ; فأخبره بقول العابد وموتها وترحمه عليها ، وكيف أراهم موضع قبرها ; فكذبه الشيطان وقال : لم يصدقكم أمر أختكم ، إنه قد أحبل أختكم وولدت منه غلاما فذبحه وذبحها معه فزعا منكم ، وألقاها في حفيرة احتفرها خلف الباب الذي كانت فيه عن يمين من دخله . فانطلقوا فادخلوا البيت الذي كانت فيه عن يمين من دخله ، فإنكم ستجدونهما هنالك جميعا كما أخبرتكم . قال : وأتى الأوسط في منامه وقال له مثل ذلك . ثم أتى أصغرهم فقال له مثل ذلك . فلما استيقظ القوم استيقظوا متعجبين لما رأى كل واحد منهم . فأقبل بعضهم على بعض ، يقول كل واحد منهم : لقد رأيت عجبا ، فأخبر بعضهم بعضا بما رأى . قال أكبرهم : هذا حلم ليس بشيء ، فامضوا بنا ودعوا هذا . قال أصغرهم : لا أمضي حتى آتي ذلك المكان فأنظر فيه . قال : فانطلقوا جميعا حتى دخلوا البيت الذي كانت فيه أختهم ، ففتحوا الباب وبحثوا الموضع الذي وصف لهم في منامهم ، فوجدوا [ ص: 38 ] أختهم وابنها مذبوحين في الحفيرة كما قيل لهم ، فسألوا العابد فصدق قول إبليس فيما صنع بهما . فاستعدوا عليه ملكهم ، فأنزل من صومعته فقدموه ليصلب ، فلما أوقفوه على الخشبة أتاه الشيطان فقال له : قد علمت أني صاحبك الذي فتنتك في المرأة حتى أحبلتها وذبحتها وذبحت ابنها ، فإن أنت أطعتني اليوم وكفرت بالله الذي خلقك خلصتك مما أنت فيه . قال : فكفر العابد بالله ; فلما كفر خلى عنه الشيطان بينه وبين أصحابه فصلبوه . قال : ففيه نزلت هذه الآية : كمثل الشيطان إذ قال للإنسان اكفر فلما كفر قال إني بريء منك إني أخاف الله رب العالمين إلى قوله جزاء الظالمين . قال ابن عباس : فضرب الله هذا مثلا للمنافقين من اليهود . وذلك أن الله تعالى أمر نبيه عليه السلام أن يجلي بني النضير من المدينة ، فدس إليهم المنافقون ألا تخرجوا من دياركم ، فإن قاتلوكم كنا معكم ، وإن أخرجوكم كنا معكم ، فحاربوا النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فخذلهم المنافقون ، وتبرءوا منهم كما تبرأ الشيطان من برصيصا العابد . فكان الرهبان بعد ذلك لا يمشون إلا بالتقية والكتمان . وطمع أهل الفسوق والفجور في الأحبار فرموهم بالبهتان والقبيح ، حتى كان أمر جريج الراهب ، وبرأه الله فانبسطت بعده الرهبان وظهروا للناس . وقيل : المعنى مثل المنافقين في غدرهم لبني النضير كمثل إبليس إذ قال لكفار قريش : لا غالب لكم اليوم من الناس ، وإني جار لكم وقال مجاهد المراد بالإنسان هاهنا جميع الناس في غرور الشيطان إياهم . ومعنى قوله تعالى : إذ قال للإنسان اكفر أي أغواه حتى قال : إني كافر .إني أخاف الله رب العالمين وليس قول الشيطان حقيقة ، إنما هو على وجه التبرؤ من الإنسان ، فهو تأكيد لقوله تعالى : إني بريء منك وفتح الياء من \" إني \" نافع وابن كثير وأبو عمرو . وأسكن الباقون ."

ذلك فدعا بتلك الكلمات فذهب عنه الشيطان فكان الأبيض يفعل مثل ذلك بالناس ويرشدهم إلى برصيصا فيدعو فيعافون فانطلق الأبيض فتعرض لجارية من بنات ملوك بني إسرائيل بين ثلاثة إخوة وكان أبوهم ملكهم فمات واستخلف أخاه فكان عمها ملك بني إسرائيل فعذبها وخنقها ثم جاء إليهم في صورة متطبب فقال لهم : أتريدون أن أعالجها قالوا : نعم قال : إن الذي عرض لها مارد لا يطاق ولكن سأرشدكم إلى رجل تثقون به تدعونها عنده إذا جاء شيطانها دعا لها حتى تعلموا أنها قد عوفيت وتردونها صحيحة قالوا : ومن هو قال برصيصا قالوا : وكيف لنا أن يجيبنا إلى هذا وهو أعظم شأنا من ذلك قال : فانطلقوا فابنوا صومعة إلى جانب صومعته حتى تشرفوا عليه فإن قبلها وإلا فضعوها في صومعتها ثم قولوا له هي أمانة عندك فاحتسب فيها .</p><p lang=\"ar\" class=\"ar \">قال : فانطلقوا إليه فسألوه فأبى عليهم فبنوا صومعة على ما أمرهم الأبيض ووضعوا الجارية في صومعته

فخنقها فدعا برصيصا بتلك الدعوات فذهب عنها الشيطان ثم أقبل على صلاته فجاءها الشيطان فخنقها فدعا برصيصا بتلك الدعوات ثم أقبل على صلاته فجاءها الشيطان فخنقها وكانت تكشف عن نفسها فجاءه الشيطان وقال واقعها فستتوب بعد فتدرك ما تريد من الأمر فلم يزل به حتى واقعها فلم يزل على ذلك يأتيها حتى حملت وظهر حملها فقال له الشيطان :</span> ويحك يا برصيصا قد افتضحت فهل لك أن تقتلها وتتوب فإن سألوك فقل : ذهب بها شيطانها فلم أقدر عليه .<span class=\"blue\"> فدخل فقتلها ثم انطلق بها فدفنها إلى جانب الجبل فجاء الشيطان وهو يدفنها ليلا فأخذ بطرف إزارها فبقي طرف خارجا من التراب ثم رجع برصيصا إلى صومعته فأقبل على صلاته إذ جاء إخوتها يتعاهدون أختهم وكانوا يجيئون في طرف الأيام يسألون عنها ويوصونه بها فقالوا :</span> يا برصيصا ما فعلت أختنا قال : قد جاء شيطانها فذهب بها ولم أطقه فصدقوه وانصرفوا فلما أمسوا وهم مكروبون جاء الشيطان إلى أكبرهم في منامه فقال : ويحك إن برصيصا فعل بأختك كذا وكذا وإنه ودفنها في موضع كذا وكذا فقال الأخ في نفسه : هذا حلم وهو من عمل الشيطان فإن برصيصا خير من ذلك .<span class=\"blue\"> قال :</span> فتتابع عليه ثلاث ليال فلم يكترث .<span class=\"blue\"> فانطلق إلى الأوسط بمثل ذلك فقال الأوسط مثل ما قاله الأكبر فلم يخبر أحدا فانطلق إلى أصغرهم بمثل ذلك فقال أصغرهم لأخويه :</span> والله لقد رأيت كذا وكذا وقال الأوسط : وأنا والله قد رأيت مثله وقال الأكبر : وأنا رأيت مثله فانطلقوا إلى برصيصا وقالوا : يا برصيصا ما فعلت أختنا قال : أليس قد أعلمتكم بحالها فكأنكم اتهمتموني فقالوا : والله لا نتهمك واستحيوا منه فانصرفوا فجاءهم الشيطان فقال : ويحكم إنها لمدفونة في موضع كذا وإن طرف إزارها خارج من التراب .<span class=\"blue\"> فانطلقوا فرأوا أختهم على ما رأوا في النوم فمشوا في مواليهم وغلمانهم ومعهم الفؤوس والمساحي فهدموا صومعته وأنزلوه ثم كتفوه فانطلقوا به إلى الملك فأقر على نفسه وذلك أن الشيطان أتاه فقال :</span> تقتلها ثم تكابر يجتمع عليك أمران : قتل ومكابرة اعترف فلما اعترف أمر الملك بقتله وصلبه على خشبة فلما صلب أتاه الأبيض فقال : يا برصيصا أتعرفني قال : لا قال : أنا صاحبك الذي علمتك الدعوات فاستجيب لك ويحك ما اتقيت الله في أمانتك ! خنت أهلها وإنك زعمت أنك أعبد بني إسرائيل أما استحييت فلم يزل يعيره ثم قال في آخر ذلك : ألم يكفك ما صنعت حتى أقررت على نفسك وفضحت نفسك وفضحت أشباهك من الناس فإن مت على هذه الحالة لم يفلح أحد من نظرائك قال : فكيف أصنع قال : تطيعني في خصلة واحدة حتى أنجيك مما أنت فيه فآخذ بأعينهم فأخرجك من مكانك ! قال : وما هي قال تسجد لي <span class=\"reference\">[ قال : ما أستطيع .<span class=\"blue\"> قال :</span> افعل

А если они будут помнить о том, что Аллах ведает об их деяниях и что ни одно из них не сокроется от Него и не будет по- теряно или предано забвению, то они непременно бросят все свои силы на совер- шение праведных поступков.\nЭтот священный аят учит людей оценивать свои деяния и быть требователь- ными к себе. Он учит их осознавать свои ошибки, не повторять их и искупать их искренним покаянием, а также избегать путей, ведущих к грехам и ослушанию Господа.

Они посвятили свою жизнь удовольствиям и низменным страстям, но не оказались в числе преуспевших и не извлекли из своих дел никакой пользы. Бо- лее того, Аллах заставил их забыть самих себя и пренебречь всем, что могло при- нести им пользу и выгоду. Их деяния затерялись, и они погубили как свою мир- скую, так и будущую жизни. Это — величайший самообман, последствия кото-\nрого невозможно исправить и раны которого невозможно залечить, потому что люди эти — закоренелые грешники, уклонившиеся от повиновения своему Гос- поду и затерявшиеся в омуте грехов.                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(20)</span> Могут ли быть равны те, кто боялся Аллаха, задумывался над тем, что его ожида- ет завтра, и заслужил Райские сады и беззаботное бытие в кругу пророков, прав- дивых верующих, павших мучеников, благочестивых праведников и всех тех, кого облагодетельствовал Аллах, и те, кто пренебрег поминанием своего Творца и Кормильца и своими обязанностями перед Ним и кто был несчастен в земном мире и заслужил страшную кару после смерти.

Ибо, если бы Коран был ниспослан на какую-либо гору, ты увидел бы, как она смиренно раскалывается от страха перед Аллахом. Это говорит о том, какое сильное воздействие оказывает Коран на человеческие сердца.\nЕго проповеди самые проникновенные, а его приказы и запреты самые вер- ные и мудрые. Они доступны для душ и необременительны для тел, лишены про- тиворечия и взаимоисключающих концепций, в них нет непреодолимых трудно- стей и принуждения. И, наконец, они пригодны для любой страны и для любой эпохи и приемлемы для каждого человека.\nЗатем Всевышний Аллах сообщил, что Он приводит людям притчи и разъяс- няет им, что им дозволено, а что запрещено, дабы они поразмыслили над Его зна- мениями. Ведь перед тем, кто размышляет над знамениями Аллаха, раскрыва- ется сокровищница знаний. Ему становятся ясны пути добра и зла, и он начина- ет обретать благородный нрав и превосходные качества и избавляться от пороков. Поэтому ничто не принесет человеку больше пользы, чем размышление над Ко- раном и постижение глубокого смысла его аятов.                </div>"

Buna göre kul, daima kendisini gözden geçirmelidir.

O bakımdan kula Kur’ân üzerinde gereği gibi tefekkür etmekten, anlamları üzerinde iyiden iyiye düşünmekten daha faydalı olacak bir şey yoktur.                </div>"

Most of them, nay, all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The color of the face of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ underwent a change when he saw them in poverty. He then entered (his house) and came out and commanded Bilal to pronounce Adhan. Bilal pronounced Adhan and Iqamah, and the Prophet led the prayer. He then addressed them, first reciting,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ</p><p>(O mankind! Have Taqwa of your Lord, Who created you from a single person... ) (4:1), until the end of the Ayah. Then he recited the Ayah that is in Surat Al-Hashr:</p><p>وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ</p><p>(and let every person look to what he has sent forth for tomorrow,\") He then said, \"A man donated his Dinar, his Dirham, from his clothes, from his Sa` of wheat, from his Sa` of dates\" -- until he said -- \"even if it was half a date.\" Then a person among the Ansar came there with a moneybag, which his hands could scarcely lift; in fact, his hands could not lift it. Then the people followed continuously, until I saw two heaps of eatables and clothes. I saw the face of the Messenger radiate with pleasure, like gold. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ سَنَّ فِي الْإِسْلَامِ سُنَّةً حَسَنَةً فَلَهُ أَجْرُهَا وَأَجْرُ مَنْ عَمِلَ بِهَا بَعْدَهُ، مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يُنْقَصَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْءٌ، وَمَنْ سَنَّ فِي الْإِسْلَامِ سُنَّةً سَيِّئَةً كَانَ عَلَيْهِ وِزْرُهَا وَوِزْرُ مَنْ عَمِلَ بِهَا، مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يُنْقَصَ مِنْ أَوْزَارِهِمْ شَيْء»</p><p>(He who sets a good example in Islam, there is a reward for him for this (act of goodness) and reward of that also who acted according to it subsequently, without any deduction from their rewards. Whoever sets in Islam an evil example, there is upon him the burden of that evil and the burden of him also who acted upon it subsequently, without any deduction from their burden.)\" Muslim recorded this Hadith via the chain of Shu`bah. Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ اتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Have Taqwa of Allah), ordains the Taqwa of Allah which pertains to obeying what He ordered and staying away from what He forbade. Allah said,</p><p>وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ</p><p>(and let every person look to what he has sent forth for tomorrow,) meaning, hold yourselves accountable before you are recompensed, and contemplate what you have kept for yourselves of good deeds for the Day of your return and being paraded before your Lord,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(Have Taqwa of Allah), again ordering Taqwa,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what you do.) Allah asserts that surely, He knows all of your deeds -- O mankind -- and actions. Nothing that pertains to you ever escapes His observation, nor any matter of yours, whether major or minor, is ever beyond His knowledge,</p><p>وَلاَ تَكُونُواْ كَالَّذِينَ نَسُواْ اللَّهَ فَأَنسَـهُمْ أَنفُسَهُمْ</p><p>(And be not like those who forgot Allah, and He caused them to forget themselves.) meaning, do not forget the remembrance of Allah, the Exalted, otherwise, He will make you forget to perform the good deeds that benefit you in your return, because the recompense is equated with the action. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>أُولَـئِكَ هُمُ الْفَـسِقُونَ</p><p>(Those are the rebellious.) referring to those who rebel against obedience to Allah, who will earn destruction on the Day of Resurrection and failure upon their return,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تُلْهِكُمْ أَمْوَلُكُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلَـدُكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْخَـسِرُونَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Let not your properties or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. And whosoever does that, then they are the losers.)(63:9)</p><h2>The Residents of Paradise and the Residents of Hell are never Equal</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>لاَ يَسْتَوِى أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ وَأَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ</p><p>(Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise.) meaning, these two categories of people are never the same with regards to the judgement of Allah, the Exalted, on the Day of Resurrection. Allah said in other Ayat,</p><p>أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُواْ السَّيِّئَـتِ أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ سَوَآءً مَّحْيَـهُمْ وَمَمَـتُهُمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</p><p>(Or do those who earn evil deeds think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous good deeds, in their present life and after their death Worst is the judgement that they make.)(45:21),</p><p>وَمَا يَسْتَوِى الاٌّعْـمَى وَالْبَصِيرُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ وَلاَ الْمُسِىءُ قَلِيـلاً مَّا تَتَذَكَّرُونَ</p><p>(And not equal are the blind and those who see; nor are those who believe and do righteous good deeds and those who do evil. Little do you remember!)(40:58), and,</p><p>أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ كَالْمُفْسِدِينَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الْمُتَّقِينَ كَالْفُجَّارِ</p><p>(Shall We treat those who believe and do righteous good deeds as corrupters on earth Or shall We treat those who have Taqwa as the wicked)(38:28) Therefore, Allah asserts that He will honor the righteous and humiliate the sinners, and this is why He said here,</p><p>أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمُ الْفَآئِزُونَ</p><p>(It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful.) that is, they are those who will earn safety and deliverance from the torment of Allah the Exalted and Most Honored.</p>"

            "text": "<p>Commentary</p><p>The Command to Taqwa and to prepare for the Day of Resurrection</p><p>The earlier parts of Surah Al-Hashr has described different events relating to the Jews, the pagans and the hypocrites and their punishments in this world and in the next. Now the concluding part of the Surah makes the believers conscious of their duty towards Allah and advises them to perform the righteous deeds regularly.</p><p>The first verse in this set reads يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّـهَ وَلْتَنظُرْ‌ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ those who believe, fear Allah, and everybody must consider what he [ or she ] has sent ahead for tomorrow 59:18) In an eloquent style, the verse enjoins upon the believers to take care of the Hereafter and commands them to prepare for it. Here a few points need to be considered:</p><p>First: In this verse, the Hereafter is described as ghad [ tomorrow ], which means the 'day after today'. This points to two things. First of all, it means that the entire period of this world, compared to the Hereafter, is very short. That is, this entire world, in relation to the Hereafter, is like one day. In fact, in terms of pure calculation, this comparison too is difficult to imagine, because the Hereafter is eternal which will exist without an end. The age of human world is said to be a few thousand years old. If this is calculated with the creation of the heaven and the earth, it will extend to a few million years, which in any case will be a limited period. This is no comparison to an unlimited or infinite period of time. Some Traditions state' اَلدُّنیَا یَومُ وَ لَنَا فِیہِ صَومُ (The entire world is a day and on that day we fast.) Whether we calculate from human creation or from the creation of the heaven and the earth, it does not matter, because neither of these factors is important for a human individual. In fact, every individual's world is made up of the days and years of his age. Every person should be able to realize how short a period that is in relation to the eternity of the Hereafter.</p><p>Second of all, this verse shows that the Day of Resurrection is as certain as the arrival of tomorrow after today which is a stark reality, and no one doubts it. Likewise the Hereafter is beyond any reasonable doubt.</p><p>Thirdly, the Day of Resurrection will happen very shortly. Just as tomorrow is not very far away from today, it is thought to be very near, likewise, the Day of Resurrection will happen very soon after this world. The first phase of the Hour is when an individual dies, his Hour is already established as stated in a Tradition: مَن مَّاتَ فَقَد قَامَت قِیَامَتُہ \"He who dies, his Day of Judgment has been established\" because the signs of the next world start from the grave and examples of reward and punishment come forward. The world of grave or the world of barzakh is like a waiting room in this world which accommodates all types of people, ranging from the first class to the third class. The waiting room of the criminals is the prison house. A person should be able to determine his position and status in the waiting room. Therefore, every person's Judgment Day starts with his death. Man's death has been made such a puzzling phenomenon that not even the greatest philosopher or scientist can with any degree of certainty determine the exact time of its occurrence. In fact, every coming moment is fraught with the danger that one may not live to see it, especially in this time and age when it is moving at the pace of lightning and heart-failure is the order of the day. The second phase of the Hour is when the entire world, the heaven and earth and everything else, will perish, though this might take place after hundreds of thousands of years, it is very close in relation to the eternity of the Hereafter.</p><p>In short, this verse by describing qiyamah [ Doomsday ] as ghad [ tomorrow ] made man conscious of the fact that the Doomsday is not very far off; it is very close like tomorrow. It is also possible that it might come even before tomorrow.</p><p>The second point put by this verse for consideration is that the arrival of Doomsday being certain and also near, everyone is invited to think what he has prepared for the Day of Resurrection. This shows that his original abode is the Hereafter. His residence in this world is like a wayfarer. It is necessary to send something from here for the eternal abode. The main purpose of man's residence is to live here, acquire and accumulate things and send them forward to the eternal abode of the Hereafter. It is quite obvious that no material wealth or property can be taken with from this world. There is only one way of transferring wealth [ gold, silver, money and so on ] from one country to another, that is to deposit it into the bank from where the currency of another country is obtained. In exactly the same manner, wealth is spent in the way of Allah and the sacred laws of Allah are implemented and deposited in the Divinely celestial bank, where the currency of reward is recorded in the celestial Account-Book. When a believer reaches the eternal abode, it is handed over to him without claim or demand.</p><p>The phrase مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ 'what he (or she) has sent ahead' carries the general sense of the good, as well as, the bad deeds. He who sends forth good deeds will obtain the currency of reward in the Hereafter; and he who sends forth evil deeds will be indicted in the Hereafter. The command of \"...fear Allah...[ 18] \" has been repeated. It could be for emphasis, or the first of such command is for man to fulfill the obligatory and imperative duties, and the repetition of the command is to abstain from sins. The second explanation is given by Maulana Ashraf\tThanawi (رح) .</p><p>Also, it is possible that the first command to fear Allah is to send forth good deeds for the Hereafter by acting upon imperatives set by Allah, and the second command to fear is to ensure that what is being sent is not fake or counterfeit. Fake or counterfeit deeds, in relation to the Hereafter, would imply the deeds done seem to be genuinely righteous deeds, but they lack sincerity of purpose and the good pleasure of Allah. What was done ostentatiously or for ulterior motive or an ostensible action that seems like an act of worship, but having no base in religion, it is tantamount to innovation (Bid'ah). Thus the second command to fear Allah implies that for the Hereafter it is not sufficient to merely accumulate ostensible actions, but to send forth genuine deeds performed with sincerity according to the rules set in religion. Spurious actions will not be acceptable there.</p>"

(আরবী) অর্থাৎ “হে মানবমণ্ডলী! তোমরা তোমাদের প্রতিপালককে ভয় কর যিনি তোমাদেরকে এক ব্যক্তি হতেই সৃষ্টি করেছেন ...।” তারপর তিনি সূরায়ে হাশরের (আরবী)-এই আয়াতটি তিলাওয়াত করেন। অতঃপর তিনি দান-খয়রাতের প্রতি মানুষকে উৎসাহিত করেন। তখন জনগণ দান-খয়রাত করতে শুরু করেন। বহু দিরহাম (রৌপ্যমুদ্রা), দীনার (স্বর্ণমুদ্রা), কাপড়-চোপড়, গম, খেজুর ইত্যাদি আসতে থাকে। রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) ভাষণ দিতেই থাকেন। এমন কি শেষ পর্যন্ত তিনি বলেনঃ “তোমরা অর্ধেক খেজুর হলেও তা নিয়ে এসো।” একজন আনসারী (রাঃ) অর্থ বোঝাই ভারী একটি থলে কষ্ট করে উঠিয়ে দিয়ে আসলেন। তারপর তো লোকদের দানের পর দান আসতেই থাকে। শেষ পর্যন্ত প্রত্যেক জিনিসের এক একটি স্কুপ হয়ে যায়। এর ফলে রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ)-এর বিবর্ণ চেহারা উজ্জ্বল হয়ে ওঠে এবং সোনার মত ঝলমল করতে থাকে। তিনি বলেনঃ “যে কেউ ইসলামের কোন ভাল কাজ শুরু করবে তাকে তার নিজের কাজের প্রতিদান তো দেয়া হবেই, এমনকি তার পরে। যে কেউই ঐ কাজটি করবে, প্রত্যেকের সমপরিমাণ প্রতিদান তাকে দেয়া হবে। এবং তাদের প্রতিদানের কিছুই কম করা হবে না। পক্ষান্তরে যে ব্যক্তি শরীয়ত বিরোধী কোন কাজ শুরু করবে, তার নিজের এ কাজের গুনাহ্ তো হবেই, এমনকি তার পরে যে কেউই ঐ কাজ করবে, প্রত্যেকেরই গুনাহ তার উপর পড়বে এবং তাদের গুনাহ্ কিছুই কম করা হবে না।” (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম আহমাদ (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন এবং ইমাম মুসলিম (রঃ) এটা তাখরীজ করেছেন)আয়াতে প্রথমে নির্দেশ হচ্ছেঃ আল্লাহর আযাব হতে বাঁচার ব্যবস্থা কর অর্থাৎ তাঁর হুকুম পালন করে এবং তাঁর নাফরমানী হতে দূরে থেকে তার শাস্তি হতে রক্ষা পাওয়ার ব্যবস্থা কর।এরপর আল্লাহ্ পাক বলেনঃ সময়ের পূর্বেই নিজের হিসাব নিজেই গ্রহণ কর। চিন্তা করে দেখতে থাকে যে, কিয়ামতের দিন যখন আল্লাহর সামনে হাযির হবে তখন কাজে লাগার মত কতটা সঞ্চিত আমল তোমাদের কাছে রয়েছে!আবার তাগীদের সাথে বলা হচ্ছেঃ আল্লাহ তাআলাকে ভয় করতে থাকো এবং জেনে রেখো যে, তোমাদের আমল ও অবস্থা সম্বন্ধে তিনি পূর্ণ ওয়াকিফহাল। না কোন ছোট কাজ তাঁর কাছে গোপন আছে, না কোন বড় কাজ তাঁর অগোচরে আছে। কোন গোপনীয় এবং কোন প্রকাশ্য কাজ তাঁর অজানা নেই।অতঃপর মহান আল্লাহ্ বলেনঃ তোমরা তাদের মত হয়ো না যারা বিস্মৃত হয়েছে, ফলে আল্লাহ তাদেরকে আত্মবিস্মৃত করেছেন। অর্থাৎ তোমরা আল্লাহর যিকিরকে ভুলে বসো না, অন্যথায় তিনি তোমাদেরকে তোমাদের ঐ সকার্যাবলী ভুলিয়ে দিবেন যেগুলো আখিরাতে কাজে লাগবে। কেননা, প্রত্যেক আমলের প্রতিদান ঐ শ্রেণীরই হয়ে থাকে। এ জন্যেই তিনি বলেনঃ তারাই তো পাপাচারী। যেমন অন্য জায়গায় তিনি বলেনঃ (আরবী) অর্থাৎ “হে মুমিনগণ! তোমাদের ঐশ্বর্য ও সন্তান-সন্ততি যেন তোমাদেরকে আল্লাহর স্মরণে উদাসীন না করে, যারা উদাসীন হবে তারাই তো ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত।” (৬৩:৯) হযরত নাঈম ইবনে নামহাহ্ (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, হযরত আবু বকর সিদ্দীক (রাঃ) তাঁর এক ভাষণে বলেনঃ “তোমরা কি জান না যে, তোমরা সকাল-সন্ধ্যায় তোমাদের নির্দিষ্ট সময়ের দিকে অগ্রসর হচ্ছ? সুতরাং তোমাদের উচিত যে, তোমরা তোমাদের জীবনের সময়গুলো আল্লাহর আনুগত্যের কাজে কাটিয়ে দিবে। আর এটা আল্লাহর দয়া ও অনুগ্রহ ছাড়া শুধু নিজের ক্ষমতার মাধ্যমে লাভ করা যায় না। যারা আল্লাহ্ তা'আলার সন্তুষ্টির কাজ ছাড়া অন্য কাজে লেগে যাবে তোমরা তাদের মত হয়ো না। আল্লাহ তোমাদেরকে এটা হতে নিষেধ করেছেন। যেমন তিনি বলেনঃ “তোমরা তাদের মত হয়ো না যারা আল্লাহকে বিস্মৃত হয়েছে, ফলে আল্লাহ তাদেরকে আত্মবিস্মৃত করেছেন।” তোমাদের পরিচিত ভাইয়েরা আজ কোথায়? তারা তাদের অতীত জীবনে যেসব আমল করেছিল তার প্রতিফল নেয়ার অথবা তার শাস্তি ভোগ করার জন্যে আল্লাহর দরবারে পৌঁছে গেছে। সেখানে তারা সৌভাগ্য লাভ করেছে অথবা হতভাগ্য হয়েছে। যেসব উদ্ধত লোক আঁকজমক পূর্ণ শহর বসিয়েছিল তারা আজ কোথায়? তারা ঐ শহরে মযবুত দূর্গসমূহ নির্মাণ করেছিল। আজ তারা কবরের গর্তে পাথরের নীচে চাপা পড়ে রয়েছে। এটা হলো আল্লাহর কিতাব কুরআন কারীম। তোমরা এর নূর হতে আলো নিয়ে নাও। এটা কিয়ামতের দিনের অন্ধকারে তোমাদের কাজে আসবে। এর সুন্দর বর্ণনা হতে তোমরা শিক্ষা গ্রহণ কর এবং সুন্দর হয়ে যাও। দেখো, আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা হযরত যাকারিয়া (আঃ) ও তাঁর পরিবারবর্গের প্রশংসা করতে গিয়ে বলেনঃ (আরবী) অর্থাৎ “নিশ্চয়ই তারা সৎকার্যে অগ্রগামী ছিল এবং বড় লোভ ও ভয়ের সাথে আমার কাছে প্রার্থনা করতো এবং আমার সামনে ঝুঁকে পড়তো।” (২১:৯০) জেনে রেখো যে, ঐ কথা কল্যাণশূন্য যার দ্বারা আল্লাহর সন্তুষ্টি উদ্দেশ্য না হয়। ঐ মাল কল্যাণ ও বরকতপূর্ণ নয় যা আল্লাহর পথে খরচ করা হয় না। ঐ ব্যক্তি সৌভাগ্য হতে দূরে রয়েছে যার মূর্খতা সহনশীলতার উপর বিজয়ী হয়েছে। অনুরূপভাবে ঐ ব্যক্তিও পুণ্যলাভে বঞ্চিত হয়েছে যে আল্লাহর আহকাম পালনের ক্ষেত্রে কোন তিরস্কারকারীর তিরস্কারকে ভয় করেছে।” (এ হাদীসটি হাফিয আবুল কাসিম তিরবানী (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন। এর ইসনাদ খুবই উত্তম এবং এর বর্ণনাকারী নির্ভরযোগ্য। যদিও এর একজন বর্ণনাকারী নাঈম ইবনে নামহাহ নামক ব্যক্তি সুপরিচিত নন, কিন্তু ইমাম আবু দাউদ সিজিস্তানী (রঃ)-এর এই ফায়সালাই যথেষ্ট যে, জারীর ইবনে উসমান (রঃ)-এর সমস্ত উস্তাদই বিশ্বাসযোগ্য এবং ইনিও তার একজন উস্তাদ)মহামহিমান্বিত আল্লাহ বলেনঃ জাহান্নামের অধিবাসী ও জান্নাতের অধিবাসী সমান নয়। অর্থাৎ কিয়ামতের দিন জাহান্নামী ও জান্নাতীরা আল্লাহ্ তা'আলার নিকট সমান হবে না। যেমন আল্লাহ্ তাবারাকা ওয়া তা'আলা বলেনঃ (আরবী) অর্থাৎ “যারা পাপকার্যে লিপ্ত রয়েছে তারা কি ধারণা করেছে যে, আমি তাদেরকে ঈমান আনয়নকারী ও সৎ আমলকারীদের মত করবে? তাদের জীবিত ও মৃত কি সমান? তারা যা ফায়সালা করছে তা কতই না নিকৃষ্ট।” (৪৫:২১) আল্লাহ তা'আলা আরো বলেনঃ (আরবী)অর্থাৎ “অন্ধ ও চক্ষুষ্মন সমান নয় এবং মুমিন ও সৎ আমলকারী এবং দুষ্কার্যকারী সমান নয়, তোমরা অল্পই উপদেশ গ্রহণ করে থাকো।” (৪০:৫৮) আর এক জায়গায় বলেনঃ (আরবী) অর্থাৎ “যারা ঈমান এনেছে ও ভাল কাজ করেছে তাদেরকে কি আমি ভূ-পৃষ্ঠে বিপর্যয় সষ্টিকারীদের মত করবে অথবা আমি কি মুত্তাকীদেরকে পাপীদের মত করবে?” (৩৮:২৮) এসব আয়াত এটাই প্রমাণ করে যে, নিশ্চয়ই আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা পুণ্যবানদেরকে সম্মানিত করেন এবং পাপীদেরকে লাঞ্ছিত করেন। এ জন্যেই এখানে আল্লাহ তা'আলা বলেনঃ জান্নাতবাসীরাই সফলকাম। অর্থাৎ মুসলমানরা আল্লাহ তা'আলার আযাব হতে পরিত্রাণ লাভকারী।</p>"

( أي كل ضر ) .وإنما لم يعرَّف بلام التعريف تنصيصاً على العموم لئلا يتوهم نفسٌ معهودةوأطلق «غد» على الزمن المستقبل مجازاً لتقريب الزمن المستقبل من البعيد لملازمة اقتراب الزمن لمفهوم الغَد ، لأن الغد هو اليوم الموالي لليوم الذي فيه المتكلم فهو أقرب أزمنة المستقبل كما قال قرّاد بن أجدع :فإن يَكُ صدْرُ هذا اليوم ولّى ... فإن غداً لناظره قريبوهذا المجاز شائع في كلام العرب في لفظ ( غد ) وأخواته قال زهير :وأعْلَمُ عِلْم اليوممِ والأمسسِ قبلَه ... ولكنني عن علم ما في غدٍ عَمِيريد باليوم الزمن الحاضر ، وبالأمس الزمن الماضي ، وبالغد الزمن المستقبل .وتنكير «غد» للتعظيم والتهويل ، أي لغدٍ لا يعرف كنهه .واللام في قوله : { لغدٍ } لام العلة ، أي ما قدمتْه لأجل يوم القيامة ، أي لأجل الانتفاع به .والتقديم : مستعار للعمل الذي يُعمل لتحصيل فائدته في زمن آت شبه قصد الانتفاع به في المستقبل بتقديم من يَحلّ في المنزل قبل ورود السائرين إليه من جيش أو سَفر ليهيّء لهم ما يصلح أمرهم ، ومنه مقدمة الجيش وتقديم الرائد قبل القافلة . قال تعالى : { وما تقدموا لأنفسكم من خير تجدوه عند الله } [ البقرة : 110 ] ويقال في ضده : أَخَّر ، إذا ترك عمل شيء قال تعالى : { علمت نفس ما قدمت وأخرت }[ الأنفطار : 5 ] .وإعادة { واتقوا الله } ليبنَى عليه { إن الله خبير بما تعملون } فيحصل الربط بين التعليل والمعلل إذ وقع بينهما فصل { ولتنظر نفس ما قدمت لغدٍ } . وإنما أعيد بطريق العطف لزيادة التأكيد فإن التوكيد اللفظي يؤتى به تارة معطوفاً كقوله تعالى : { أولى لك فأولى ثم أولى لك فأولى } [ القيامة : 34 ، 35 ] وقوله : { كلا سوف تعلمون ثم كلا سوف تعلمون } [ التكاثر : 3 4 ] . وقول عدي بن زيد : «وألفَى قولها كذباً ومَيناً» .وذلك أن في العطف إيهام أن يكون التوكيد يجعل كالتأسيس لزيادة الاهتمام بالمؤكد .فجملة { إن الله خبير بما تعملون } تعليل للحث على تقوى الله وموقع { إنَّ } فيها موقع التعليل .ويجوز أن يكون { اتقوا الله } المذكور أولاً مراداً به التقوى بمعنى الخوف من الله وهي الباعثة على العمل ولذلك أردف بقوله : { ولتنظر نفس ما قدمت لغدٍ } ويكون { اتقوا الله } المذكور ثانياً مراداً به الدوام على التقوى الأولى ، أي ودوموا على التقوى على حد قوله تعالى : { يا أيها الذين آمنوا آمنوا بالله ورسوله } [ النساء : 136 ] ولذلك أردف بقوله : { إن الله خبير بما تعملون } أي بمقدار اجتهادكم في التقوى ، وأردف بقوله : { ولا تكونوا كالذين نسوا الله فأنساهم أنفسهم } [ الحشر : 19 ] أي أهملوا التقوى بعد أن تقلّدوها كما سيأتي أنهم المنافقون فإنهم تقلّدوا الإِسلام وأضاعوه قال تعالى : { نسوا الله فنسيهم إن المنافقين هم الفاسقون } [ التوبة : 67 ] . وفي قوله : { إن الله خبير بما تعملون } إظهار اسم الجلالة في مقام الإِضمار ، فتكون الجملة مستقلة بدلالتها أتمّ استقلال فتجري مجرى الأمثال ولتربية المهابة في نفس المخاطبين ."

Tidak ada kontradiksi dan pertentangan, tidak ada sesuatu yang sulit dan penyimpangan di dalam al-Qur`an. Sesuai dengan segala waktu dan tempat serta cocok untuk setiap orang. Selanjut-nya Allah سبحانه وتعالى memberitahukan bahwa Dia membuat perumpamaan untuk manusia dan menjelaskan halal dan haram dalam kitabNya untuk para hambaNya, agar mereka mau memikirkan dan mere-nungkan tanda-tanda kebesaran Allah سبحانه وتعالى. Karena dengan memikir-kan tanda-tanda kebesaran Allah سبحانه وتعالى, seorang hamba akan mampu membuka berbagai perbendaharaan ilmu. Allah سبحانه وتعالى juga menjelas-kan jalan kebaikan dan keburukan bagi para hambaNya, mendo-rong untuk berakhlak dan bersifat yang baik, dan melarang manusia dari berbagai akhlak buruk.

Воистину, если люди устремят свои взоры и сердца к Последней жизни и задумаются над своим местом в ней, то они станут усердно совершать добрые дела, снося все препоны и преграды, возникающие на их пути, сворачивающие их с него и мешающие им продвигаться вперед. А если они будут помнить о том, что Аллах ведает об их деяниях и что ни одно из них не сокроется от Него и не будет потеряно или предано забвению, то они непременно бросят все свои силы на совершение праведных поступков. Этот священный аят учит людей оценивать свои деяния и быть требовательными к себе. Он учит их осознавать свои ошибки, не повторять их и искупать их искренним покаянием, а также избегать путей, ведущих к грехам и ослушанию Господа. Он также заставляет их задуматься над своими упущениями, дабы они приложили усилия для того, чтобы исправить их, испрашивая при этом помощи у Всемогущего Создателя. Человек должен всегда сравнивать милость и добродетель Аллаха по отношению к нему со своими упущениями, потому что подобное осознание своего долга перед Аллахом подталкивает человека в лоно праведности. А тот, кто пренебрегает этим, лишается великого добра и уподобляется людям, которые забыли Аллаха и пренебрегли Его поминанием и выполнением своих обязанностей перед Ним. Они посвятили свою жизнь удовольствиям и низменным страстям, но не оказались в числе преуспевших и не извлекли из своих дел никакой пользы. Более того, Аллах заставил их забыть самих себя и пренебречь всем, что могло принести им пользу и выгоду. Их деяния затерялись, и они погубили как свою мирскую, так и будущую жизни. Это - величайший самообман, последствия которого невозможно исправить и раны которого невозможно залечить, потому что люди эти - закоренелые грешники, уклонившиеся от повиновения своему Господу и затерявшиеся в омуте грехов."

اور انہیں مخاطب ہو کر کہا کہ یہ ہے میرے فلسفہ خودی کا ماخذ ! اب آیئے فَاَنْسٰٹہُمْ اَنْفُسَہُمْ کے مفہوم پر غور کریں۔ کیا کوئی شخص اپنے آپ کو اس طرح بھول سکتا ہے کہ وہ خوداپنی شخصیت سے ہی واقف نہ رہے ؟ کیا کوئی انسان ایسا بھی ہوسکتا ہے جسے اپنے پیٹ کا خیال نہ رہے ؟ یا جسے اپنی کوئی بیماری یاد نہ رہے ؟ ظاہر ہے کوئی انسان اپنے جسم اور اس کے تقاضوں سے غافل نہیں ہوسکتا۔ تو معلوم ہوا کہ حیوانی جسم کے علاوہ انسان کی کوئی اور حیثیت بھی ہے جسے وہ بھول جاتا ہے اور وہ ہے انسان کی اصل حقیقت یعنی اس کی ”روح“۔ جہاں تک انسان کے اللہ کو بھلانے کا تعلق ہے اس کا ذکر سورة المجادلہ کی آیت 19 میں بھی آیا ہے : { اِسْتَحْوَذَ عَلَیْھِمُ الشَّیْطٰنُ فَاَنْسٰٹھُمْ ذِکْرَ اللّٰہِط } ”شیطان نے ان پر قابو پا لیا ہے ‘ پس انہیں اللہ کی یاد سے غافل کردیا ہے“۔ اب آیت زیر مطالعہ میں ایسے لوگوں کی اس سزا کا ذکر ہے جو انہیں دنیوی زندگی میں ہی مل جاتی ہے۔ یعنی جو لوگ شیطان کے بہکاوے میں آکر اللہ کو بھول جاتے ہیں اللہ تعالیٰ انہیں ان کی اصل حقیقت سے غافل کردیتا ہے۔ پھر ان لوگوں کو یہ بھی یاد نہیں رہتا کہ وہ انسان ہیں ‘ اشرف المخلوقات ہیں یا اللہ کے بندے ہیں۔ انہیں بس یہی یاد رہ جاتا ہے کہ بہت سے حیوانات کی طرح وہ بھی ایک حیوان ہیں۔  آج ہماری جدید تہذیب بھی مختلف انداز سے ہمیں یہی سبق پڑھانے کی کوشش میں ہے کہ انسان محض ایک حیوان ہے۔ اس فلسفے کو متعارف کرانے اور پروان چڑھانے میں بنیادی کردار ڈارون کے نظریہ ارتقاء Evolution Theory نے ادا کیا ہے۔ اس تھیوری کا خلاصہ یہ ہے کہ ایک حیوان اور انسان میں بنیادی فرق صرف ارتقاء کے مراحل اور مدارج کا ہے۔ جیسے گدھے اور گھوڑے میں صرف یہ فرق ہے کہ گدھا نچلے درجے کا rough coarse جانور ہے ‘ جبکہ گھوڑا ارتقاء کا ایک مزید مرحلہ طے کر کے نسبتاً بہتر درجے میں چلا گیا ہے اور ایک refined اور تمکنت والاجانور ہے ‘ اسی طرح کا فرق ایک گوریلے chimpanzee اور انسان میں ہے۔ یعنی گوریلے کے مقابلے میں انسان نسبتاً بہتر قسم کا جانور ہے ‘ باقی ان دونوں کے جبلی تقاضے instincts اور محرکات motives میں کوئی فرق نہیں ہے۔۔۔۔ - جدید سائیکالوجی بھی انہی خطوط پر چل رہی ہے۔ چناچہ آج کے سائیکالوجسٹ کو بھی محرکاتِ عمل کے حوالے سے انسان اور حیوان میں کوئی فرق نظر نہیں آتا۔ تو جب یہ فرق مٹ گیا اور انسان اپنی اصلیت کو بھلا کر حیوان بن گیا تو گویا وہ ہر قسم کی اخلاقی پابندیوں سے بھی آزاد ہوگیا۔ انیسویں صدی کے فرنچ لٹریچر میں بنیادی طور پر اسی نکتے کو فوکس کیا گیا ہے کہ حیوانات کی زندگی فطرت کے عین مطابق ہے ‘ اس لیے ہم انسانوں کو ان سے سبق لیتے ہوئے اپنی زندگی کو خواہ مخواہ کے تکلفات سے آزاد کرلینا چاہیے۔ مثلاً تمام حیوانات لباس سے بےنیاز ہیں ‘ اس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ لباس فطرت کا تقاضا نہیں ہے ‘ انسان کی اپنی ایجاد ہے۔ اسی طرح بیوی ‘ بیٹی اور ماں کی تمیز بھی حیوانات میں نہیں پائی جاتی ‘ یہ پابندی بھی انسان نے اپنے اوپر خود ہی عائد کی ہے۔ یہ ہے آج کے انسان کا المیہ ! بہرحال یہ آیت ہمیں اس حقیقت سے آگاہ کرتی ہے کہ جو انسان اللہ کو بھلا دیتا ہے اللہ تعالیٰ اسے اس کی حقیقت سے غافل کردیتا ہے۔ انسان کی روح خود اللہ تعالیٰ نے اس کے اندر پھونکی ہے اور اسی کی وجہ سے وہ ”انسان“ کے مرتبے پر فائز ہوا ہے۔ چناچہ جب کوئی انسان اپنی روح اور اس کے تقاضوں سے غافل ہوجاتا ہے تو وہ انسان کے درجے سے گر کر حیوان بن جاتا ہے۔ اس حوالے سے اپنشد کا یہ جملہ بہت اہم ہے : Man in his ignorance identifies himself with the material sheeths that encompass his real self.اسی real self کا دوسرانام ”انا“ ہے ‘ لیکن اس سے اصل مراد انسان کی ”روح“ ہی ہے ‘ جسے علامہ اقبال نے فلسفیانہ انداز میں ”خودی“ کا نام دیا ہے : ؎ نقطہ نوری کہ نام او خودی ست زیر خاک ما شرار زندگی ست ؎ ہے ذوق تجلی بھی اسی خاک میں پنہاں غافل تو نرا صاحب ِادراک نہیں ہے ! اس ساری بحث کا خلاصہ یہ ہے کہ انسان حیوانی جسم اور روح کا مرکب ہے۔ بقول شیخ سعدی :آدمی زادہ طرفہ معجون است از فرشتہ سرشتہ وز حیوان یعنی آدمی ایک ایسی معجونِ مرکب ہے جس میں فرشتہ اور حیوان دونوں ُ گندھے ہوئے ہیں۔ فرشتے سے مراد یہاں وہ نورانی روح ہے جو عالم امر کی چیز ہے : { وَیَسْئَلُوْنَکَ عَنِ الرُّوْحِط قُلِ الرُّوْحُ مِنْ اَمْرِ رَبِّیْ وَمَآ اُوْتِیْتُمْ مِّنَ الْعِلْمِ اِلاَّ قَلِیْلاً۔ } بنی اسرائیل ”اور اے نبی ﷺ ! یہ لوگ آپ سے پوچھتے ہیں روح کے بارے میں۔ آپ فرما دیجیے کہ روح میرے رب کے امر میں سے ہے اور تمہیں نہیں دیا گیا علم مگر تھوڑا سا“۔ چناچہ انسان کی روح نورانی چیز ہے اور اس کا تعلق اللہ تعالیٰ سے ہے۔ اگر انسان اللہ کو بھلا دے گا تو اپنی روح یعنی اپنی اصلیت سے بیگانہ ہو کر محض ایک حیوان بن کر رہ جائے گا۔ اس کے بعد اس کی نظر میں اچھے برے اور حلال و حرام کی کوئی تمیز نہیں رہے گی۔ انسانی معاشرے کے ایسے ہی افراد آیت زیر مطالعہ کے حکم ”اُولٰٓـئِکَ ھُمُ الْفٰسِقُوْنَ“ کے مصداق ہیں۔</p>"

If this is the case with a mountain which is hard and huge, that if it was made able to comprehend and understand this Qur'an, will feel humble and crumble from fear of Allah the Exalted, then what about you -- O mankind Why do your hearts not feel softness and humbleness from the fear of Allah, even though you understand Allah's command and comprehend His Book This is why Allah said,</p><p>وَتِلْكَ الاٌّمْثَـلُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</p><p>(Such are the parables which We put forward to mankind that they may reflect.) There is a Hadith of the Mutawatir grade that states that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ had someone make him a Minbar. Before that, he used to stand next to a tree trunk in the Masjid to deliver speeches. So, when the Minbar was made and placed in the Masjid, the Prophet came to deliver a speech and passed the tree trunk, headed towards the Minbar, the tree trunk started weeping, just like an infant. The tree trunk missed hearing the remembrance of Allah and the revelation that were being recited next to it. In one of the narrations for this Hadith, Al-Hasan Al-Basri said after narrating the Hadith, \"You - mankind -- are more worthy to miss the Messenger of Allah ﷺ than the tree trunk!\" tLikewise, this honorable Ayah asks that if the solid mountains feel humble and are rent asunder from the fear of Allah, if it heard Allah's Speech and comprehended it, what about you -- O mankind -- who heard the Qur'an and understood it Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَلَوْ أَنَّ قُرْآنًا سُيِّرَتْ بِهِ الْجِبَالُ أَوْ قُطِّعَتْ بِهِ الاٌّرْضُ أَوْ كُلِّمَ بِهِ الْمَوْتَى</p><p>(And if there had been a Qur'an with which mountains could be moved, or the earth could be cloven asunder, or the dead could be made to speak.)(13:31) We mentioned the meaning of this Ayah as stating that, if there were a Qur'an that has these qualities, it would be this Qur'an. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَإِنَّ مِنَ الْحِجَارَةِ لَمَا يَتَفَجَّرُ مِنْهُ الأَنْهَـرُ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَشَّقَّقُ فَيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ الْمَآءُ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَهْبِطُ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(And indeed, there are stones out of which rivers gush forth, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which split asunder so that water flows from them, and indeed, there are of them which fall down for fear of Allah.)(2:74)</p><h2>Glorifying Allah the Exalted by mentioning His Names and Attributes</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِى لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ هُوَ الرَّحْمَـنُ الرَّحِيمُ</p><p>(He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.) Allah states that He Alone is worthy of worship, there is no Lord or God for the existence, except Him. All that is being worshipped instead of Allah are false deities. Allah is the All-Knower in the unseen and the seen, He knows all that pertains to the creations that we see, and those we cannot see. Nothing in heaven or on earth ever escapes His knowledge, no matter how great or insignificant, big or small, including ants in darkness. Allah's statement,</p><p>هُوَ الرَّحْمَـنُ الرَّحِيمُ</p><p>(He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.) was duly explained before at the very beginning of this Tafsir, so it is not necessary to repeat it here, and it asserts that Allah is the Owner of the wide encompassing mercy that entails all of His creation. He is Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim of this life and the Hereafter. Allah the Exalted said in other Ayat,</p><p>وَرَحْمَتِى وَسِعَتْ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ</p><p>(And My mercy embraces all things.)(7:156),</p><p>كَتَبَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ الرَّحْمَةَ</p><p>(Your Lord has written (prescribed) mercy for Himself.)(6:54), and,</p><p>قُلْ بِفَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَبِرَحْمَتِهِ فَبِذَلِكَ فَلْيَفْرَحُواْ هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</p><p>(Say: \"In the bounty of Allah, and in His mercy; -- therein let them rejoice.\" That is better than what (the wealth) they amass.)(10:58) Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِى لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْمَلِكُ</p><p>(He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, Al-Malik.) Al-Malik, meaning \"The Owner and King of all things,\" Who has full power over them without resistance or hindrance. Allah's statement,</p><p>الْقُدُّوسُ</p><p>(Al-Quddus,) meaning \"The Pure,\" according to Wahb bin Munabbih, while Mujahid and Qatadah said that Al-Quddus means \"The Blessed.\" Ibn Jurayj said that Al-Quddus means \"He Whom the honorable angels glorify.\"</p><p>السَّلَـمُ</p><p>(As-Salam,) meaning \"Free from any defects or shortcomings that lessen or decrease His perfect attributes and actions.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>الْمُؤْمِنُ</p><p>(Al-Mu'min,) means \"Who has granted safety to His servants by promising that He will never be unjust to them, \" according to Ad-Dahhak who reported it from Ibn `Abbas. Qatadah said that Al-Mu'min means that \"Allah affirms that His statements are true,\" while Ibn Zayd said that it means, \"He attested to His faithful servants' having faith in Him.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>الْمُهَيْمِنُ</p><p>(Al-Muhaymin,) means, according to Ibn `Abbas and others, \"The Witness for His servants actions,\" that is, the Ever-Watcher over them. Allah said in similar Ayat,</p><p>وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدٌ</p><p>(And Allah is Witness over all things.)(58:6),</p><p>ثُمَّ اللَّهُ شَهِيدٌ عَلَى مَا يَفْعَلُونَ</p><p>(and moreover Allah is Witness over what they used to do.)(10:46), and,</p><p>أَفَمَنْ هُوَ قَآئِمٌ عَلَى كُلِّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ</p><p>(Is then He (Allah) Who takes charge (guards) of every person and knows all that he has earned)(13:33) Allah said,</p><p>الْعَزِيزُ</p><p>(Al-`Aziz,) meaning that \"He is the Almighty, Dominant over all things.\" Therefore, His majesty is never violated, due to His might, greatness, irresistible power and pride. Allah said;</p><p>الْجَبَّارُ الْمُتَكَبِّرُ</p><p>(Al-Jabbar, Al-Mutakabbir), meaning \"The Only One worthy of being the Compeller and Supreme.\" There is a Hadith in the Sahih Collection in which Allah said,</p><p>«الْعَظَمَةُ إِزَارِي، وَالْكِبْرِيَاءُ رِدَائِي، فَمَنْ نَازَعَنِي وَاحِدًا مِنْهُمَا عَذَّبْتُه»</p><p>(Might is My Izar and pride is My Rida; if anyone disputes any one of them with Me, then I will punish him.) Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ اللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ</p><p>(Glory be to Allah! (High is He) above all that they associate as partners with Him.), then He said,</p><p>هُوَ اللَّهُ الْخَـلِقُ الْبَارِىءُ الْمُصَوِّرُ</p><p>(He is Allah, Al-Khaliq, Al-Bari, Al-Musawwir.) Al-Khaliq refers to measuring and proportioning, Al-Bari refers to inventing and bringing into existence what He has created and measured. Surely, none except Allah is able to measure, bring forth and create whatever He wills to come to existence. Allah's statement,</p><p>الْخَـلِقُ الْبَارِىءُ الْمُصَوِّرُ</p><p>(Al-Khaliq, Al-Bari, Al-Musawwir.) means, if Allah wills something, He merely says to it \"be\" and it comes to existence in the form that He wills and the shape He chooses,</p><p>فِى أَىِّ صُورَةٍ مَّا شَآءَ رَكَّبَكَ</p><p>(In whatever form He willed, He put you together.)(82:8) Allah describing Himself as being Al-Musawwir, Who brings into existence anything He wills in the shape and form He decides.</p><h2>Al-Asma' Al-Husna</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>لَهُ الاٌّسْمَآءُ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(To Him belong Al-Asma' Al-Husna (the Best Names).) We explained the meaning of this Ayah in the Tafsir of Surat Al-A`raf. The Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ للهِ تَعَالَى تِسْعَةً وَتِسْعِينَ اسْمًا، مِائَةً إِلَّا وَاحِدًا، مَنْ أَحْصَاهَا دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ، وَهُوَ وِتْرٌ يُحِبُّ الْوِتْر»</p><p>(Allah the Exalted has ninety-nine Names, one hundred less one; whoever then preserves them, will enter Paradise. Allah is Witr (One) and He likes the Witr.)</p><h2>Everything praises and glorifies Allah</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him.) is similar to His other statement,</p><p>تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ السَّمَـوَتُ السَّبْعُ وَالاٌّرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ وَإِن مِّن شَىْءٍ إِلاَّ يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدَهِ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تَفْقَهُونَ تَسْبِيحَهُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ حَلِيمًا غَفُورًا</p><p>(The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft--Forgiving.)(17:44) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ</p><p>(and He is Al-`Aziz) The Almighty, meaning, His greatness is never humbled,</p><p>الْحَكِيمُ</p><p>(Al-Hakim) the All-Wise, in His legislation and decrees This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Hashr. All praise is due to Allah.</p>"

(আরবী) ভাবার্থ এই যে, ওরা প্রত্যেকেই কি মাথার উপর স্ব-স্ব কৃতকম নিয়ে দণ্ডায়মান নয়? (১৩:৩৩)তিনিই পরাক্রমশালী। প্রত্যেক জিনিস তাঁর আদেশ পালনে বাধ্য। প্রত্যেক মাখলুকের উপর তিনি বিজয়ী। সুতরাং তার মর্যাদা, শ্রেষ্ঠত্ব, শক্তিমত্তা এবং বড়ত্ব দেখে কেউই তাঁর মুকাবিলা করতে পারে না। তিনিই প্রবল এবং তিনিই মহিমান্বিত। শ্রেষ্ঠত্ব ও গৌরব প্রকাশ করা শুধু তাঁরই জন্যে শোভনীয়। অহংকার করা শুধু তারই সাজে। যেমন সহীহ্ হাদীসে এসেছে যে, আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা বলেনঃ “বড়াই করা আমার ইযার এবং অহংকার করা আমার চাদর। সুতরাং যে ব্যক্তি এ দু'টোর যে কোন একটি নিয়ে আমার সাথে টানাটানি করবে, আমি তাকে শাস্তি প্রদান করবে।” সমস্ত কাজের সংস্কার ও সংশোধন তারই হাতে। তিনি প্রত্যেক কুকর্মকে ঘৃণাকারী। যারা নির্বুদ্ধিতার কারণে অন্যদেরকে আল্লাহর শরীক স্থাপন করে, আল্লাহ তা হতে পবিত্র ও মহান। তিনিই আল্লাহ সৃজনকর্তা, তিনিই উদ্ভাবনকর্তা। অর্থাৎ তিনিই ভাগ্য নির্ধারণকারী এবং তিনিই ওটাকে জারী ও প্রকাশকারী। তিনি যা চান তাই নির্ধারণ করেন। কেউই এমন নেই যে, ভাগ্য নির্ধারণ ও ওটাকে চালু এ দু'টোই করতে পারে। তিনি নিজের ইচ্ছামত ভাগ্য নির্ধারণ করেন, অতঃপর ওটা অনুযায়ী ওকে চালিয়েও থাকেন। কখনো তিনি এতে পার্থক্য সৃষ্টি হতে দেন না। বহু পরিমাণ ও পরিমাপকারী এবং বিন্যাসকারী রয়েছে যারা পরিমাণ ও পরিমাপ করার পর ওটাকে জারী করতে এবং ওটা অনুযায়ী চালু করতে সক্ষম নয়। পরিমাণ ও পরিমাপ করার সাথে সাথে তফীযের উপরও যিনি ক্ষমতা রাখেন তিনিই আল্লাহ্। সুতরাং (আরবী) দ্বারা (আরবী) এবং (আরবী) দ্বারা (আরবী) উদ্দেশ্য। আরবে এই শব্দগুলো এই অর্থে বরাবরই দৃষ্টান্ত স্বরূপ পেশ করার প্রচলন রয়েছে।আল্লাহ্ তা'আলার শান বা মাহাত্ম্য এই যে, যে জিনিসকে তিনি যখন যেভাবে করার ইচ্ছা করেন তখন শুধু 'হও' বলে দেন, আর তখনই তা ঐ ভাবেই এবং ঐ আকারেই হয়ে যায়। যেমন তিনি বলেনঃ (আরবী) অথাৎ “যেই আকৃতিতে চেয়েছেন, তিনি তোমাকে গঠন করেছেন।” (৮২:৮) এজন্যেই এখানে বলেনঃ তিনি রূপদাতা। অর্থাৎ যাকে তিনি যেভাবে গঠন করার ইচ্ছা করেন সেভাবেই করে থাকেন।সকল উত্তম নাম তারই। সূরায়ে আ'রাফে এই বাক্যটির তাফসীর গত হয়েছে। তাছাড়া ঐ হাদীসটিও বর্ণিত হয়েছে যেটি সহীহ বুখারী ও সহীহ মুসলিমে হযরত আবু হুরাইরা (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণনা করা হয়েছে। তা এই যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ্ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “আল্লাহ্ তা'আলার নিরানব্বইটি অর্থাৎ এক কম একশ’টি নাম রয়েছে। যে ব্যক্তি ওগুলো গণনা করবে ও স্মরণ রাখবে সে জান্নাতে প্রবেশ করবে। তিনি (আল্লাহ) বে-জোড় অর্থাৎ তিনি একক এবং বে-জোড়কে অর্থাৎ একাকীকে ভালবাসেন।” জামেউত তিরমিযীতে নামগুলো স্পষ্টভাবে এসেছে। নামগুলো হলোঃ  আল্লাহ, তিনি ছাড়া কোন মা’বূদ নেই, তিনিই (১) রহমান, (২) রাহীম, (৩) মালিক, (৪) কুদুস, (৫) সালাম, (৬) মুমিন, (৭) মুহাইমিন, (৮) আযীয, (৯) জাব্বার, (১০) মুতাকাব্বির, (১১) খালিক, (১২) বারী, (১৩) মুসাব্বির, (১৪) গাফফার, (১৫) অহ্হাব, (১৬) রাযযাক, (১৭) কাহহার, (১৮) ফাত্তাহ্, (১৯) আলীম, (২০) কাবি, (২১) বাসিত, (২২) খাফি, (২৩) রাফি’, (২৪) মুইয্য, (২৫) মুযিল্ল, (২৬) সামী', (২৭) বাসীর, (২৮) হাকীম, (২৯) আদৃল, (৩০) লাতীফ, (৩১) খাবীর, (৩২) হালীম, (৩৩) আযীম, (৩৪) গাফুর, (৩৫) শাকূর, (৩৬) আলী, (৩৭) কাবীর, (৩৮) হাফী, (৩৯) মুকীত, (৪০) হাসীব, (৪১) জালীল, (৪২) কারীম, (৪৩) রাকীব, (৪৪) মুজীব, (৪৫) ওয়াসি, (৪৬) হাকীম, (৪৭) অদূদ, (৪৮) মাজীদ, (৪৯) বাই’স (৫০) শাহীদ, (৫১) হাক্ক, (৫২) অকীল, (৫৩) কাবী, (৫৪) মাতীন, (৫৫) ওয়ালী, (৫৬) হামীদ, (৫৭) মুহসী, (৫৮) মুবদী, (৫৯) মুঈদ, (৬০) মুহঈ, (৬১) মুমীত, (৬২) হাই, (৬৩) কাইয়ুম, (৬৪) ওয়াজিদ, (৬৫) মাজিদ, (৬৬) ওয়াহিদ, (৬৭) সামাদ, (৬৮) কাদির, (৬৯) মুকতাদির, (৭০) মুকাদিম, (৭১) মুআখির, (৭২) আওয়াল, (৭৩) আখির, (৭৪) যাহির, (৭৫) বাতিন, (৭৬) ওয়ালী, (৭৭) মুতাআলী, (৭৮) বারর, (৭৯) তাওয়াব, (৮০) মুনতাকিম, (৮১) আফু, (৮২) রাউফ, (৮৩) মালিকুল মুলক, (৮৪) যুলজালালি ওয়াল ইকরাম, (৮৫) মুকসিত, (৮৬) জামি, (৮৭) গানী, (৮৮) মুগনী, (৮৯) মুতী, (৯০) মানি, (৯১) যারর, (৯২) নাফি, (৯৩) নূর, (৯৪) হাদী, (৯৫) বাদী, (৯৬) বাকী, (৯৭) ওয়ারিস, (৯৮) রাশীদ (৯৯) সাবূর।সুনানে ইবনে মাজাহতেও এ হাদীসটি বর্ণিত হয়েছে এবং তাতে কিছু আগা-পিছা এবং কম-বেশীও রয়েছে। মোটকথা, এসব হাদীস ইত্যাদির বর্ণনা পূর্ণরূপে সূরায়ে আ'রাফের তাফসীরে গত হয়েছে। সুতরাং এখানে শুধু এটুকু লিখাই যথেষ্ট। বাকী সবগুলোর পুণরাবৃত্তি নিষ্প্রয়োজন।মহান আল্লাহ্ বলেনঃ আকাশমণ্ডলী ও পৃথিবীতে যা কিছু আছে, সমস্তই তাঁর পবিত্রতা ও মহিমা ঘোষণা করে। যেমন তিনি অন্য জায়গায় বলেনঃ (আরবী)অর্থাৎ “সপ্ত আকাশ, পৃথিবী এবং এগুলোর মধ্যস্থিত সব কিছু তাঁরই পবিত্রতা ও মহিমা ঘোষণা করে এবং এমন কিছু নেই যা তাঁর সপ্রশংসা পবিত্রতা ও মহিমা ঘোষণা করে না। কিন্তু ওদের পবিত্রতা ও মহিমা ঘোষণা তোমরা অনুধাবন করতে পার না। তিনি সহনশীল, ক্ষমাপরায়ণ।” (১৭:৪৪)তিনি পরাক্রমশালী, প্রজ্ঞাময়। অর্থাৎ তিনি তাঁর শরীয়তের আহকামের ব্যাপারে অতীব জ্ঞানী ও বিজ্ঞানময়।  হযরত মাকাল ইবনে ইয়াসার (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, নবী (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “যে ব্যক্তি সকালে (আরবী) পড়ার পর সূরায়ে হাশরের শেষ তিনটি আয়াত পাঠ করে, তার জন্যে আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা সত্তর হাজার ফেরেশতা নিযুক্ত করে দেন যারা সন্ধ্যা পর্যন্ত তার উপর রহমত বর্ষণ করতে থাকেন। যদি ঐ দিনে তার মৃত্যু হয়ে যায় তবে তাকে শহীদের মর্যাদা দান করা হয়। আর যে ব্যক্তি সন্ধ্যায় এগুলো পাঠ করে সেও অনুরূপ মর্যাদা লাভ করে থাকে।” (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম আহমাদ (রঃ) স্বীয় মুসনাদে বর্ণনা করেছেন। জামি তিরমিযীতেও এ হাদীসটি রয়েছে এবং ইমাম তিরমিযী (রঃ) এটাকে গারীব বলেছেন)</p>"

Ибо, если бы Коран был ниспослан на какую-либо гору, ты увидел бы, как она смиренно раскалывается от страха перед Аллахом. Это говорит о том, какое сильное воздействие оказывает Коран на человеческие сердца. Его проповеди самые проникновенные, а его приказы и запреты самые верные и мудрые. Они доступны для душ и необременительны для тел, лишены противоречия и взаимоисключающих концепций, в них нет непреодолимых трудностей и принуждения. И, наконец, они пригодны для любой страны и для любой эпохи и приемлемы для каждого человека. Затем Всевышний Аллах сообщил, что Он приводит людям притчи и разъясняет им, что им дозволено, а что запрещено, дабы они поразмыслили над Его знамениями. Ведь перед тем, кто размышляет над знамениями Аллаха, раскрывается сокровищница знаний. Ему становятся ясны пути добра и зла, и он начинает обретать благородный нрав и превосходные качества и избавляться от пороков. Поэтому ничто не принесет человеку больше пользы, чем размышление над Кораном и постижение глубокого смысла его аятов."

Только Аллах знает абсолютно все свои имена и эпитеты, но все они прекрасны и совершенны. Они свидетельствуют о возвышенных ка- чествах Господа, которые лишены недостатков и изъянов.

It means that He provides safety and perfect peace to those who believe in Allah and His Messengers.</p><p>الْمُهَيْمِنُ The attribute Al-Muhaimin, according to Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، Mujhid and Qatadah means 'Guardian'.

It could also be derived from the word jabr, meaning to 'join broken bones' and thus we have the word jabirah, which refers to the bandage or plaster that is used in binding the broken bones. From this point of view, the attribute would mean that Allah is the Being Who sets aright every broken and useless things, matters or restores all losses and rectifies situations or mends every breakage.</p><p>الْمُتَكَبِّرُ‌ The attribute Al-Mutakabbir [ the Lord of Greatness ] is derived from takabbur and that from kibriya' meaning 'greatness' which is one of the peculiar characteristics of Allah. It implies that every greatness is attributable only to Allah who is not in need of anyone. Whoever is in need cannot be great. Therefore, if this word is used for a person other than Allah, it is a defect and sin, because the claim of greatness by a person who is not actually great is false and tantamount to a claim of being a partner of Allah, the Besought of all, in one of His exclusive attributes. That is why the word Al-Mutakabbir, when attributed to Allah is an attribute of perfection, but in respect of others it is no more than a false claim.</p>"

بالمصدر للمبالغة في الوصف ، أي ذو السلام ، أي السلامة ، وهي أنه تعالى سالَمَ الخلقَ من الظلم والجور . وفي الحديث « إن الله هو السلام ومنه السّلام » وبهذا ظهر تعقيب وصف { الملك } بوصف { السلام } فإنه بعد أن عُقب ب { القدوس } للدلالة على نزاهة ذاته ، عُقب ب { السلام } للدلالة على العدل في معاملته الخلق ، وهذا احتراس أيضاً .و { المؤمن } اسم فاعل من آمن الذي همزته للتعدية ، أي جعل غيره آمناً .فالله هو الذي جعل الأمان في غالب أحوال الموجودات ، إذ خلق نظام المخلوقات بعيداً عن الأخطار والمصائب ، وإنما تَعْرِض للمخلوقات للمصائب بعوارض تتركب من تقارن أو تضاد أو تعارض مصالح ، فيرجَع أقواها ويَدحض أدناها ، وقد تأتي من جرّاء أفعال الناس .وذكر وصف { المؤمن } عقب الأوصاف التي قبله إتمام للاحتراس من توهّم وصفه تعالى ب { الملك } أنه كالملوك المعروفين بالنقائص . فأفيد أولاً نزاهة ذاته بوصف { القدوس } ، ونزاهة تصرفاته المغيَّبة عن الغدر والكَيد بوصف { المؤمن } ، ونزاهةُ تصرفاته الظاهرةِ عن الجور والظلم بوصف { السلام } .و { المهيمن } : الرقيب بلغة قريش ، والحافظ في لغة بقية العرب .واختلف في اشتقاقه فقيل : مشتق من أمَنَ الداخل عليه همزة التعدية فصار آمَن وأن وزن الوصففِ مُؤَيْمِن قلبت همزته هاء ، ولعل موجب القلب إرادة نقله من الوصف إلى الاسمية بقطع النظر عن معنى الأمن ، بحيث صار كالاسم الجامد . وصار معناه : رقب : ( ألا ترى أنه لم يبق فيه معنى إلا من الذين في المؤمن لمّا صار اسماً للرقيب والشاهد ) ، وهو قلب نادر مثل قلب همزة : أراق إلى الهاء فقالوا : هَراق ، وقد وضعه الجوهري في فصل الهمزة من باب النون ووزنه مفَعْلِل اسم فاعل من آمن مثل مُدحرج ، فتصريفه مُؤَأْمِن بهمزتين بعد الميم الأولى المزيدة ، فأبدلت الهمزة الأولى هاء كما أبدلت همزة آراق فقالوا : هراق .وقيل : أصله هَيْمن بمعنى : رَقب ، كذا في «لسان العرب» وعليه فالهاء أصلية ووزنه مُفَيْعل . وذَكره صاحب «القاموس» في فصل الهاء من باب النون ولم يذكره في فصل الهمزة منه . وذكره الجوهري في فصل الهمزة وفصل الهاء من باب النون مصرحاً بأن هاءه أصلها همزة . وعدل الراغب وصاحب «الأساس» عن ذكر . وذلك يشعر بأنهما يريان هاءه مبدلة من الهمزة وأنه مندرج في معاني الأمن .وفي «المقصد الأسنى في شرح الأسماء الحسنى» للغزالي { المهيمن } في حق الله : القائم على خلقه بأعمالهم وأرزاقهم وآجالهم ، وإنما قيامه عليهم باطلاعه واستيلائه وحفظه . والإِشرافُ ، ( أي الذي هو الإطلاع ) يرجع إلى العلم ، والاستيلاءُ يرجع إلى كمال القدرة ، والحفظُ يرجع إلى الفعل . والجامعُ بين هذه المعاني اسمه { المهيمن } ولن يجتمع عَلَى ذلك الكمال والإِطلاققِ إلا الله تعالى ، ولذلك قيل : إنه من أسماء الله تعالى في الكتب القديمة ا ه . وفي هذا التعريف بهذا التفصيل نظر ولعله جرى من حجة الإِسلام مجرى الاعتبار بالصفة لا تفسير مدلولها .وتعقيب { المؤمن } ب { المهيمن } لدفع توهم أن تأمينه عن ضعف أو عن مخافة غيره ، فأُعلموا أن تأمينه لحكمته مع أنه رقيب مطلع على أحوال خلقه فتأمينه إياهم رحمة بهم .و { العزيز } الذي لا يُغلب ولا يُذلّه أحد ، ولذلك فسر بالغالب .و { الجبار } : القاهر المُكرِه غيره على الانفعال بفعله ، فالله جبار كل مخلوق على الانفعال لما كوّنه عليه لا يستطيع مخلوق اجتياز ما حدّه له في خلقته فلا يستطيع الإِنسان الطيران ولا يستطيع ذوات الأربع المشي على رجلين فقط ، وكذلك هو جبّار للموجودات على قبول ما أراده بها وما تعلقت به قدرته عليها .وإذا وصف الإِنسان بالجبار كان وصف ذمّ لأنه يشعر بأنه يحمل غيره على هواه ولذلك قال تعالى : { إن تريد إلا أن تكون جباراً في الأرض وما تريد أن تكون من المصلحين } [ القصص : 19 ] . فالجبار من أمثلة المبالغة لأنه مشتق من أجبره ، وأمثلة المبالغة تشتق من المزيد بقلة مثل الحكيم بمعنى المحكم . قال الفراء : لم أسمع فَعَّالاً في أفعَلَ إلا جبّاراً ودَرَّاكاً . وكان القياس أن يقال : المجبر والمُدرك ، وقيل : الجبار معناه المصلح من جبر الكَسر ، إذَا أصلحه ، فاشتقاقه لا نذرة فيه .و { المتكبر } : الشديد الكبرياء ، أي العظمة والجلالة . وأصل صيغة التفعل أن تدل على التكلف لكنها استعملت هنا في لازم التكلف وهو القوة لأن الفعل الصادر عن تأنق وتكلف يكون أتقن .ويقال : فلان يتظلم على الناس ، أي يكثر ظلمهم .ووجه ذكر هذه الصفات الثلاث عقب صفة { المهيمن } أن جميع ما ذكره آنفاً من الصفات لا يؤذن إلا باطمئنان العباد لعناية ربهم بهم وإصلاح أمورهم وأن صفة { المهيمن } تؤذن بأمر مشترك فعقبت بصفة { العزيز } ليعلم الناس أن الله غالب لا يعجزه شيء . وأتبعت بصفة { الجبار } الدالة على أنّه مسخر المخلوقات لإِرادته ثم صفة { المتكبر } الدالة على أنه ذو الكبرياء يصغر كل شيء دون كبريائه فكانت هذه الصفات في جانب التخويف كما كانت الصفات قبلها في جانب الإِطماع .{ المتكبر سبحان الله عَمَّا } .ذيلت هذه الصفات بتنزيه الله تعالى عن أن يكون له شركاء بأن أشرك به المشركون . فضمير { يشركون } عائد إلى معلوم من المقام وهم المشركون الذين لم يزل القرآن يقرعهم بالمواعظ ."

He has given particular shapes to all creatures whereby they are distinguished from one another. Every species has a shape distinguishable from all other species. Within one species too, there are differences in shape between males and females. Then there are uncountable differences between the shapes of the individuals of even one sex. The excellence of shaping or fashioning is of such high degree that the shapes of zillions of men and women are different from one another in a way that no face is an absolute copy of some other face. Had it not been so, no one could be distinguished from the other. This excellence and perfection of creative power belongs to none but Allah. Just as takabbur (show of greatness) is not permissible for anyone other than Allah [ as kibriya' is His exclusive attribute'], likewise no one, besides Allah, is permitted to do picture-making, because that too is the exclusive characteristic of Allah, and picture-making is an implied claim of being associate with Allah in this attribute.</p><p>لَهُ الْأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنَىٰ (... His are the Most Beautiful Names ....59:24). The Holy Qur'an has not given the exact number of these Most Beautiful Names of Allah. Authentic Prophetic ahadith have counted them ninety-nine. Tirmidhi has collected all the ninety-nine names in one Tradition. Many scholars have written full books on the subject of Asma ul-Husna or 'Most Beautiful Names of Allah'. The present writer has also compiled a concise monograph on the subject of 'Most Beautiful Names of Allah' published as an annexure to Munajat-i-Maqbul (by Maulana Ashraf Thanawi (رح)).</p><p>يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْ‌ضِ (...His purity is proclaimed by all that is in the heavens and the earth ....59:24). That all creatures in the heavens and the earth declare the purity of Allah in unuttered language is self-evident: The wonderful, marvelous and amazing things created by Allah, and the awe-inspiring and staggering shapes fashioned by Him proclaim the praises of their Creator in unuttered language. However, it is possible too that the word 'tasbih' is used here in its real and literal sense, because according to the authentic view everything in this universe has some kind of sense that accords to its ability. Now, the foremost and primary requirement of this sense is to recognize one's Creator and paying gratitude to Him. Based on this premise, it is not far-fetched to conceive that everything in nature really declares the purity of Allah in articulate language, though human ears might not be able to hear it. Thus the Qur'an on one occasion says وَلَـٰكِن لَّا تَفْقَهُونَ تَسْبِيحَهُمْ (...but you do not understand their extolling.) (17:44)</p><p>Benefits and Blessings of the Concluding Verses of Surah Al-Hashr</p><p>It is recorded in Tirmidhi on the authority of Sayyidna Ma'qil Ibn Yasar ؓ that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ has stated that Allah appoints 70, 000 angels who pray for Divine mercy for anyone who recites the following three times: اَعُوذُ بِاللہِ اَلسَّمِیعِ اَلعَلِیمِ مِنَ اَلشَّیطَانِ الرَّجِیمِ and the last three verses of Surah Al-Hashr هُوَ اللَّـهُ الَّذِي لَا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ. If he dies the same day, he will attain the status of a martyr. If a person recites the same solemn words in the evening, he will attain the same status.

البارىء المصور } .القول في ضمير { هو } المفتتح به وفي تكرير الجملة كالقول في التي سبقتها . فإن كان ضمير الغيبة ضميرَ شأن فالجملة بعده خبر عنه .وجملة { الله الخالق } تفيد قصراً بطريق تعريف جزأي الجملة هو الخالق لا شركاؤهم . وهذا إبطال لإلهية ما لا يخلق . قال تعالى : { والذين تدعون من دون الله لا يخلقون شيئاً وهم يخلقون } [ النحل : 20 ] ، وقال : { أفمن يخلق كمن لا يخلق أفلا تذكرون } [ النحل : 17 ] ، وإن كان عائداً على اسم الجلالة المتقدم فاسم الجلالة بعده خبر عنه و { الخالق } صفة .و { الخالق } : اسم فاعل من الخلق ، وأصل الخلق في اللغة إيجاد شيء على صورة مخصوصه . وقد تقدم عند قوله تعالى حكاية عن عيسى عليه السّلام { إني أخلق لكم من الطين كهيئة الطير } الآية [ 49 ] في سورة آل عمران . ويطلق الخلق على معنى أخص من إيجاد الصور وهو إيجاد ما لم يكن موجوداً . كقوله تعالى : { ولقد خلقنا السماوات والأرض وما بينهما في ستة أيام } [ ق : 38 ] . وهذا هو المعنى الغالب من إطلاق اسم الله تعالى { الخالق } .قال في «الكشاف» : «المقدر لما يوجده» . ونقل عنه في بيان مراده بذلك أنه قال : «لما كانت إحداثات الله مقدرة بمقادير الحكمة عبر عن إحداثه بالخلق» ا ه . يشير إلى أن الخالق في صفة الله بمعنى المحدث الأشياء عن عدم ، وبهذا يكون الخلق أعم من التصوير . ويكون ذكر { البارىء } و { المصور } بعد { الخالق } تنبيهاً على أحوال خاصة في الخلق . قال تعالى : { ولقد خلقناكم ثم صورناكم } [ الأعراف : 11 ] على أحد التأويلين .وقال الراغب : الخلق التقدير المستقيم واستعمل في إيداع الشيء من غير أصل ولا احتذاء ا ه .وقال أبو بكر ابن العربي في «عارضة الأحوذي» على «سنن الترمذي» : { الخالق } : المخرج الأشياء من العدم إلى الوجود المقدر لها على صفاتها ( فخلط بين المعنيين ) ثم قال : فالخالق عام ، والبارىء أخص منه ، والمصور أخص من الأخص وهذا قريب من كلام صاحب «الكشاف» . وقال الغزالي في «المقصد الأسنى» : الخالق البارىء المصور قد يظن أن هذه الأسماء مترادفة ولا ينبغي أن يكون كذلك بل كل ما يخرج من العدم إلى الوجود يفتقر إلى تقدير أولاً ، وإلى الإيجاد على وفق التقدير ثانياً ، وإلى التصوير بعد الإِيجاد ثالثاً ، والله خالق من حيث أنه مقدِّر وبارىء من حيث إنه مخترع موجود ، ومصور من حيث إنه مرتبٌ صور المخترعات أحسن ترتيب ا ه . فجعل المعاني متلازمة وجعل الفرق بينها بالاعتبار ، ولا أحسبه ينطبق على مواقع استعمال هذه الأسماء .و { البارىء } اسم فاعل من بَرَأَ مهموزاً . قال في «الكشاف» المميز لما يوجده بعضه من بعض بالأشكال المختلفة ا ه . وهو مغاير لمعنى الخالق بالخصوص . وفي الحديث\" من شر ما خلق وذرأ وبرأ \" ومن كلام علي رضي الله عنه : لا والذي فلق الحبة وبرأ النَّسَمة ، فيكون اسم البريئة غير خاص بالناس في قوله تعالى : { أولئك هم شر البريئة أولئك هم خير البريئة } [ البينة : 6 ، 7 ] . وقال الراغب : البريئة : الخلق .وقال ابن العربي في «العارضة» : { البارىء } : خالق الناس من البرَى ( مقصوراً ) وهو التراب خاصاً بخلق جنس الإِنسان ، وعليه يكون اسم البريئة خاصاً بالبشر في قوله تعالى : { أولئك هم شر البريئة أولئك هم خير البريئة .وفسره ابن عطية بمعنى الخالق . وكذلك صاحب القاموس } . وفسره الغزالي بأنه الموجود المخترع ، وقد علمت أنه غير منطبق فأحسن تفسير له ما في «الكشاف» .و { المصور } : مكوّن الصور لجميع المخلوقات ذوات الصور المرئية .وإنما ذكرت هذه الصفات متتابعة لأن من مجموعها يحصل تصور الإِبداع الإلهي للإِنسان فابتدىء بالخلق الذي هو الإِيجاد الأصلي ثم بالبرء الذي هو تكوين جسم الإِنسان ثم بالتصّور الذي هو إعطاء الصورة الحسنة ، كما أشار إليه قوله تعالى : { الذي خلقك فسواك فعدلك في أي صورة } [ الانفطار : 7 ، 8 ] ، { الذي يصوركم في الأرحام كيف يشاء } [ آل عمران : 6 ] .ووجه ذكرها عقب الصفات المتقدمة ، أي هذه الصفات الثلاث أريد منها الإِشارة إلى تصرفه في البشر بالإِيجاد على كيفيته البديعة ليثير داعية شكرهم على ذلك . ولذلك عقب بجملة { يسبح له ما في السموات والأرض } .واعلم أن وجه إرجاع هذه الصفات الحُسنى إلى ما يناسبها مما اشتملت عليه السورة ينقسم إلى ثلاثة أقسام ولكنها ذكرت في الآية بحسب تناسب مواقع بعضها عقب بعض من تنظير أو احتراس أو تتميم كما علمته آنفاً .القسم الأول : يتعلق بما يناسب أحوال المشركين وأحلافِهم اليهود المتألبين على النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وعلى المسلمين بالحرب والكيد والأذى ، وأنصارهم من المنافقين المخادعين للمسلمين .وإلى هذا القسم تنضوي صفة { لا إله إلا هو } [ الحشر : 23 ] وهذه الصفة هي الأصل في التهيؤ للتدبر والنظر في بقية الصفات ، فإن الإِشراك أصل الضلالات ، والمشركون هم الذين يُغرون اليهود ، والمنافقون بين يهود ومشركين تستروا بإظهار الإِسلام ، فالشرك هو الذي صدّ الناس عن الوصول إلى مسالك الهدى ، قال تعالى : { وما زادوهم غيرَ تتبيب } [ هود : 101 ] .وصفة { عالم الغيب } [ الحشر : 22 ] فإن من أصول الشرك إنكار الغيب الذي من آثاره إنكار البعث والجزاء ، وعلى الاسترسال في الغي وإعمال السيئات وإنكار الوحي والرسالة . وهذا ناظر إلى قوله تعالى : { ذلك بأنهم شاقوا الله ورسوله } [ الأنفال : 13 ] الآية .وكذلك ذكر صفات «المَلِك ، والعزيز ، والجبار ، والمتكبر» ، لأنها تناسب ما أنزله ببني النضير من الرعب والخزي والبطشة .القسم الثاني : متعلق بما اجْتناه المؤمنون من ثمرة النصر في قصة بني النضير ، وتلك صفات : { السلام المؤمن } [ الحشر : 23 ] لقوله : { فما أوجفتم عليه من خيل ولا ركاب } [ الحشر : 6 ] ، أي لم يتجشم المسلمون للغنى مشقة ولا أذى ولا قتالاً .وكذلك صفتا{ الرحمان الرحيم } [ الحشر : 22 ] لمناسبتهما لإِعطاء حظ في الفيء للضعفاء .القسم الثالث : متعلق بما يشترك فيه الفريقان المذكوران في هذه السورة فيأخذ كل فريق حظه منها ، وهي صفات : «القدوس ، المهيمن ، الخالق ، البارىء ، المصور» .{ المصور لَهُ الاسمآء } .تذييل لما عُدّد من صفات الله تعالى ، أي له جميع الأسماء الحسنى التي بعضها الصفات المذكورة آنفاً .والمراد بالأسماء الصفات ، عبر عنها بالأسماء لأنه متصف بها على ألسنة خلقه ولكونها بالغة منتهى حقائقها بالنسبة لوصفه تعالى بها فصارت كالأعلام على ذاته تعالى .والمقصود : أن له مدلولات الأسماء الحسنى كما في قوله تعالى : { ثم عرضهم على الملائكة بعد قوله : وعلم آدم الأسماء كلها } [ البقرة : 31 ] ، أي عرض المسميات على الملائكة .وقد تقدم قوله تعالى : { ولله الأسماء الحسنى فادعوه بها } في سورة [ الأعراف : 180 ] .ه4س59ش24ن8/ن16-->الحسنى يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ مَا فِى السماوات والارض وَهُوَ العزيز } .جملة { يسبح له } الخ في موضع الحال من ضمير { له الأسماء الحسنى } يعني أن اتصافه بالصفات الحسنى يضطر ما في السماوات والأرض من العقلاء على تعظيمه بالتسبيح والتنزيه عن النقائص فكل صنف يبعثه علمه ببعض أسماء الله على أن ينزهه ويسبحه بقصد أو بغير قصد . فالدُهري أو الطبائعي إذا نوّه بنظام الكائنات وأعجب بانتساقها فإنما يسبح في الواقع للفاعل المختار وإن كان هو يدعوه دَهراً أو طبيعة ، هذا إذا حمل التسبيح على معناه الحقيقي وهو التنزيه بالقول ، فأما إن حمل على ما يشمل المعنيين الحقيقي والمجازي من دلالة على التنزيه ولو بلسان الحال . فالمعنى : أن ما ثبت له من صفات الخلق والإِمداد والقهر تدل عليه شواهد المخلوقات وانتظام وجودها .وجملة { وهو العزيز الحكيم } عطف على جملة الحال وأوثر هاتان الصفتان لشدة مناسبتهما لنظام الخلق .وفي هذه الآية رد العجز على الصدر لأن صدر السورة مماثل لآخرها .روى الترمذي بسند حسن عن معقل بن يسار عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : \" من قال حين يُصبح ثلاثَ مرّات : أعوذ بالله السميع العليم من الشيطان الرجيم ، ثم قرأ الثلاث آيات من آخر سورة الحشر { هو الله الذي لا إله إلا هو عالم الغيب } [ الحشر : 22 ] إلى آخر السورة ، وكَّل الله به سبعين ألف ملك يصلون عليه حتى يُمسِيَ ، وإن مات ذلك اليومَ مات شهيداً . ومن قالها حين يمسي كان بتلك المنزلة \" فهذه فضيلة لهذه الآيات أخروية .وروى الخطيب البغدادي في «تاريخه» بسنِده إلى إدريس بن عبد الكريم الحداد قال : قرأت على خلف ( راوي حمزة ) فلما بلغت هذه الآية { لو أنزلنا هذا القرآن على جبل } [ الحشر : 21 ] إلى آخر السورة قال : ضع يدك على رأسك فإني قرأت على الأعْمش . فلما بلغتُ هذه الآية قال : ضع يدك على رأسك فإني قرأت على يَحيى بن وثاب ، فلما بلغت هذه الآية قال : ضع يدك على رأسك فإني قرأت على علقمة والأسود فلما بلغت هذه الآية قالا : ضع يدك على رأسك فإنّا قرأنا على عبد الله فلما بلغنا هذه الآية قال : ضعا أَيديكما على رؤوسكما ، فإني قرأت على النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فلما بلغتُ هذه الآية قال لي : ضع يدك على رأسك فإن جبريل لما نزل بها إليَّ قال : ضعَ يدك على رأسك فإنها شفاء من كل داء إلا السام .والسام الموت . قلت : هذا حديث أغر مسلسل إلى جبريل عليه السلام .وأخرج الديلمي عن علي وابن مسعود عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم أنه قال في قوله تعالى : { لو أنزلنا هذا القرآن } [ الحشر : 21 ] إلى آخر السورة : هي رُقية الصداع ، فهذه مزية لهذه الآيات ."

This fact is of such grave import that it is enough to make even mountains tremble. But man is so negligent, forgetful and insensitive that, even after knowing this awesome fact, he is not perturbed. The names of God mentioned here are, on the one hand, an introduction to God’s Being. On the other hand, they show how Great is that Being who is the Creator of human beings and who keeps a constant watch over them. If an individual actually realises this, he will be completely engrossed in the remembrance and praises of God. The universe, by virtue of its creative meaningfulness, mirrors the attributes of God. It is itself wholly taken up with singing the praises of God and urges human beings to follow suit.</p>"
