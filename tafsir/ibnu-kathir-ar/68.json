            "text": "<p>Commentary</p><p>Linkage of Surahs</p><p>The preceding Surah dealt with the existence of Allah, His Oneness, and His knowledge and power, and adduced, as a positive proof of these attributes, was the fact that Allah is the Creator of death and life, and of the entire universe through whose component parts there runs the beautiful order that pervades the cosmos. He has created man to serve a sublime object and to achieve a noble goal. But man in his ingratitude has always rejected the Divine Message and consequently has been incurring Divine scourge. This is mentioned, in Surah Al-Mulk, with particular reference to the pagans of Makkah. The present Surah deals with the truth of the Holy Prophet's ﷺ claim, and gives sound and solid proof of it. Thus it rebuts the criticisms and taunts of the pagans against the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Their first criticism was that he is [ God forbid!] insane whereas he was perfectly sane person, an embodiment of knowledge and a paragon of virtues. Another reason why they probably called him insane is that whenever an installment of revelation descended upon the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، a physical change came over him. For instance the colour of his face would change and become red, or he would sometimes snore or he would at other times appear to be in grief, or there were times when he would hang his head down. When any of these states was over, he would recite the revealed verses to the people. This matter was beyond the understanding and perception of the pagans. Therefore, they regarded this experience of receiving revelation as insanity. Or they called him insane presumably because he put forward to his people and to the whole world that there is no object worthy of worship except Allah. He put it to them that their self-carved idols cannot be gods because they are insensate and lacking knowledge; and they lack the ability to benefit or harm anyone. His voice of Truth sounded alone yet with this lone voice of Truth without any apparent means and support, he stood unwaveringly against the whole world. People without any insight or foresight did not think that it was possible for him to achieve his goal and they called it insanity. Some called him insane for the sake of calling him insane, without any reason. Having no excuse to refute the teachings of Allah's Messenger ﷺ ، all the pagans could do was to dub him insane. The initial verses of Surah Al-Qalam refute under emphatic oath their false charges.</p><p>ن وَالْقَلَمِ وَمَا يَسْطُرُ‌ونَ مَا أَنتَ بِنِعْمَةِ رَ‌بِّكَ بِمَجْنُونٍ (Nun, by the pen and what they write, with the grace of your Lord, you are not insane....68:1-2). The letter Nun is one of the isolated letters that have been revealed at the beginning of many Surahs. They are the secret signs and symbols and mysteries of Allah. Allah alone knows their hidden meaning, or Allah made their mysterious meanings known to His Messenger. The Ummah is not permitted to investigate the hidden meaning of such isolated letters.</p><p>Pen and its Significance</p><p>In the phrase wal-qalami, the waw is the particle of oath [ translated here as 'by the pen']. 'Qalam' refers to 'pen', and there are three types of pen: [ 1] the pen of destinies; [ 2] the pen of angels; and [ 3] the pen of human beings. It could refer to any or all of these types of pen. A pen is an object that is used for writing anything [ as is the view of Abu Hatim Al-Busti ]. According to Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، it specifically refers to the pen of destinies. Sayyidna ` Ubadah Ibn Samit ؓ narrates regarding the pen of destinies that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: \"The first thing Allah created was the pen, and He told it to write, and when it asked Him what it should write, He told it to write what was predestined, so it wrote what would take place to all eternity.\" [ Transmitted by At-Tirmidhi, saying that this is a Tradition whose chain of narrators is gharib ]. Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: \"Allah recorded the destiny of all creatures 50, 000 years before creating the heavens and the earth.\" [ Sahib Muslim ]. Qatadah (رح) says that pen is a great gift of Allah that He has endowed upon His servants. Some scholars say that Allah first created the pen, and that was the pen of decrees which recorded the destinies of the entire universe and all the creatures. Then He created the second pen that is used by the inhabitants of the earth. The second pen is referred to in Surah Iqra' in verse [ 96:4], thus: عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ '{ He who} taught by the pen'. And Allah knows best!</p><p>If qalam 'pen' in the verse under comment refers to the pen of destinies, its greatness and its superiority over everything is quite obvious and swearing by it is quite understandable. If it is taken to refer to all pens in general, including the pen of destinies, the pen of angels, and also the pen of human beings, swearing an oath by it is apt because all great tasks are accomplished by pen. In the conquests of territories, pen play a mighty role: 'The pen is mightier than the sword' goes the famous saying. Abu HatimAl-Busti has encapsulated this idea in two short verses:</p><p>اذا اقسم الابطال یوما بسیفھم وَعدّوہ ممّا یکسب المجد وَ الکرم</p><p>When the brave people swear by their sword some day,</p><p>And count it among things that give honour and veneration to men,</p><p>کفٰی قلم الکتاب عزّا ورفعۃ مدی الدّھر انّ اللہ اقسم بالقلم</p><p>The writers' pen is sufficient for their honour and superiority</p><p>For all times to come, because Allah has sworn oath by the pen</p><p>In any case, it is immaterial whether the pen in the verse refers to the pen of destinies or it refers to the pen of creation in general. Then it swears an oath by مَا يَسْطُرُ‌ونَ 'what they write [ 1] '.</p><p>In other words, swearing an oath by what the pens have written or what they will record in the future, Allah refutes the unbelievers' false charge of madness that they made against the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، thus:</p><p>مَا أَنتَ بِنِعْمَةِ رَ‌بِّكَ بِمَجْنُونٍ (with the grace of your Lord, you are not insane....68:2). The verse contains the phrases بِنِعْمَةِ رَ‌بِّكَ (with the grace of your Lord....68:2). It states not only the claim, but also evidence to support and substantiate the statement of claim. [ See special note below.] Man is required to turn the pages of history, and he will realize that a person as great as the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ، upon whom Allah has conferred great blessings and grace, cannot be insane. Calling such a sane person insane is itself insanity.</p><p>Special Note</p><p>Scholars have explained the Qur'anic concept of 'oath': Wherever Allah has sworn an oath by an object or a phenomenon, its subject has been cited as evidence or testimony to support and substantiate the claim. Here the phrase مَا يَسْطُرُ‌ونَ 'what they write [ 1] '. Is the proof of the claim, that is, world history has been cited as testimony for critics to look into the pages of history, if they can ever find a person of such lofty calibre as the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ، with high morals insane. He takes care of other people's sanity. The next verse reinforces the subject.</p>"

This has been dis- cussed at length previously and there is no need to repeat it here.</p><h2>The Explanation of the Pen Concerning</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالْقَلَمِ</p><p>(By the pen) The apparent meaning is that this refers to the actual pen that is used to write. This is like Allah's saying,</p><p>اقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ الاٌّكْرَمُ - الَّذِى عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ - عَلَّمَ الإِنسَـنَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ</p><p>(Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught by the pen. He has taught man that which he knew not.) (96:3-5) Therefore, this statement is Allah's swearing and alerting His creatures to what He has favored them with by teaching them the skill of writing, through which knowledge is attained. Thus, Allah continues by saying,</p><p>وَمَا يَسْطُرُونَ</p><p>(and by what they Yastur.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said that this means, \"what they write.\" As-Suddi said, \"The angels and the deeds of the servants they record.\" Others said, \"Rather, what is meant here is the pen which Allah caused to write the decree when He wrote the decrees of all creation, and this took place fifty-thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.\" For this, they present Hadiths that have been reported about the Pen. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Al-Walid bin `Ubadah bin As-Samit that he said, \"My father called for me when he was dying and he said to me: `Verily, I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا خَلَقَ اللهُ الْقَلَمُ فَقَالَ لَهُ: اكْتُبْ، قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ وَمَا أَكْتُبُ؟ قَالَ: اكْتُبِ الْقَدَرَ وَمَا هُوَ كَائِنٌ إِلَى الْأَبَد»</p><p>(Verily, the first of what Allah created was the Pen, and He said to it: \"Write.\" The Pen said: \"O my Lord, what shall I write\" He said: \"Write the decree and whatever will throughout eternity.\")\" This Hadith has been recorded by Imam Ahmad through various routes of transmission. At-Tirmidhi also recorded it from a Hadith of Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi and he (At-Tirmidhi) said about it, \"Hasan Sahih, Gharib.\"</p><h2>Swearing by the Pen refers to the Greatness of the Prophet</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>مَآ أَنتَ بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ بِمَجْنُونٍ</p><p>(You, by the grace of your Lord, are not insane.) meaning -- and all praise is due to Allah -- `you are not crazy as the ignorant among your people claim. They are those who deny the guidance and the clear truth that you have come with. Therefore, they attribute madness to you because of it.'</p><p>وَإِنَّ لَكَ لاّجْراً غَيْرَ مَمْنُونٍ</p><p>(And verily, for you will be reward that is not Mamnun.) meaning, `for you is the great reward, and abundant blessings which will never be cut off or perish, because you conveyed the Message of your Lord to creation, and you were patient with their abuse.' The meaning of:</p><p>غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</p><p>(not Mamnun) is that it will not be cut off. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>عَطَآءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ</p><p>(a gift without an end.) (11:108) and His statement,</p><p>فَلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</p><p>(Then they shall have a reward without end.) (95:6) Mujahid said,</p><p>غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</p><p>(Without Mamnun) means \"Without reckoning.\" And this refers back to what we have said before.</p><h2>The Explanation of the Statement: \"Verily, You are on an Exalted Character.\"</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلَى خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(And verily, you are on an exalted (standard of) character.) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"Verily, you are on a great religion, and it is Islam.\" Likewise said Mujahid, Abu Malik, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd also said this. Sa`id bin Abi `Arubah reported from Qatadah that he said concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلَى خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(And verily, you are on an exalted (standard of) character.) \"It has been mentioned to us that Sa`d bin Hisham asked `A'ishah about the character of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, so she replied: `Have you not read the Qur'an' Sa`d said: `Of course.' Then she said: `Verily, the character of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was the Qur'an.\"' `Abdur-Razzaq recorded similar to this and Imam Muslim recorded it in his Sahih on the authority of Qatadah in its full length. This means that he would act according to the commands and the prohibition in the Qur'an. His nature and character were patterned according to the Qur'an, and he abandoned his natural disposition (i.e., the carnal nature). So whatever the Qur'an commanded, he did it, and whatever it forbade, he avoided it. Along with this, Allah gave him the exalted character, which included the qualities of modesty, kindness, bravery, pardoning, gentleness and every other good characteristic. This is like that which has been confirmed in the Two Sahihs that Anas said, \"I served the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for ten years, and he never said a word of displeasure to me (Uff), nor did he ever say to me concerning something I had done: `Why did you do that' And he never said to me concerning something I had not done: `Why didn't you do this' He had the best character, and I never touched any silk or anything else that was softer than the palm of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. And I never smelled any musk or perfume that had a better fragrance than the sweat of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.\" Imam Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara' said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ had the most handsome face of all the people, and he had the best behavior of all of the people. And he was not tall, nor was he short.\" The Hadiths concerning this matter are numerous. Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi has a complete book on this subject called Kitab Ash-Shama'il. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ never struck a servant of his with his hand, nor did he ever hit a woman. He never hit anything with his hand, except for when he was fighting Jihad in the cause of Allah. And he was never given the option between two things except that the most beloved of the two to him was the easiest of them, as long as it did not involve sin. If it did involve sin, then he stayed farther away from sin than any of the people. He would not avenge himself concerning anything that was done to him, except if the limits of Allah were transgressed. Then, in that case he would avenge for the sake of Allah.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا بُعِثْتُ لِأُتَمِّمَ صَالِحَ الْأَخْلَاق»</p><p>(I have only been sent to perfect righteous behavior.) Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith. In reference to Allah's statement,</p><p>فَسَتُبْصِرُ وَيُبْصِرُونَ - بِأَيِّكُمُ الْمَفْتُونُ</p><p>(You will see, and they will see, which of you is afflicted with madness.) then it means, `you will know, O Muhammad -- and those who oppose you and reject you, will know -- who is insane and misguided among you.' This is like Allah's statement,</p><p>سَيَعْلَمُونَ غَداً مَّنِ الْكَذَّابُ الاٌّشِرُ</p><p>(Tomorrow they will come to know who is the liar, the insolent one!) (54:26) Allah also says,</p><p>وَإِنَّآ أَوْ إِيَّاكُمْ لَعَلَى هُدًى أَوْ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(And verily (either) we or you are rightly guided or in plain error.) (34:24) Ibn Jurayj reported from Ibn `Abbas, it means \"You will know and they will know on the Day of Judgement.\" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>بِأَيِّكُمُ الْمَفْتُونُ</p><p>(Which of you is Maftun (afflicted with madness) means which of you is crazy. This was also said by Mujahid and others as well. The literal meaning of Maftun is one who has been charmed or lured away from the truth and has strayed from it. Thus, the entire statement means, `so you will know and they will know,' or `you will be informed and they will be informed, as to which of you is afflicted with madness.' And Allah knows best. Then Allah says,</p><p>إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُهْتَدِينَ</p><p>(Verily, your Lord is the best Knower of him who has gone astray from His path, and He is the best Knower of those who are guided.) meaning, `He knows which of the two groups are truly guided among you, and He knows the party that is astray from the truth.'</p>"

Sumpah Allah سبحانه وتعالى ini menafikan sifat gila yang dituduhkan itu karena nikmat dan kebaikan RabbNya, karena Dia menganugerahkan akal yang sem-purna, pandangan yang arif, dan perkataan yang fasih yang meru-pakan hal terbaik yang ditulis pena dan dicatat oleh manusia.

Beliau selalu berada di puncak tertinggi pada masing-masing akhlak baik. Rasulullah a adalah sosok lembut, mudah <span class=\"green\">(bergaul)</span> dan dekat dengan orang, mendatangi undangan orang, memenuhi keperluan orang yang meminta sebagai pelipur lara orang yang meminta, beliau selalu memberi dan tidak menolak dalam keadaan gagal <span class=\"green\">(tidak membawa hasil)</span>. Apabila sahabat-sahabat beliau menginginkan sesuatu dari Rasulullah a, beliau mengiyakan dan mengikuti mereka jika tidak ada halangan. Jika bertekad melaku-kan sesuatu, beliau tidak pernah memutuskan sendiri, namun berembug dengan para sahabat. Rasulullah a adalah sosok yang menerima kebaikan orang, memaafkan kesalahan orang dan selalu memperlakukan teman secara baik dan sempurna. Beliau tidak pernah bermuka kusam, tidak pernah berkata kasar, tidak bersikap dingin, tidak pernah terselip lidah, tidak pernah dendam dengan perlakuan dingin orang, namun justru dibalas dengan kebaikan dan beliau sangat penyabar, semoga shalawat dan salam terlimpahkan kepada beliau.                </div><div lang=\"ms\" class=\"ms \">\n<span class=\"green\">(5-6)</span> Karena Allah سبحانه وتعالى menempatkan Rasulullah a di posisi tertinggi dalam berbagai hal sedangkan para musuhnya menuduh sebagai orang gila dan sakit, maka Allah سبحانه وتعالى berfirman, ﴾ فَسَتُبۡصِرُ    وَيُبۡصِرُونَ  5  بِأَييِّكُمُ  ٱلۡمَفۡتُونُ   6  ﴿ \"Maka kelak kamu akan melihat dan mereka <span class=\"green\">(orang-orang kafir)</span> pun akan melihat, siapa di antara kamu yang gila.\" Jelas sudah, Rasulullah a adalah orang yang paling lurus dan paling sempurna terhadap dirinya dan orang lain, sedangkan musuh-mu-suhnya adalah orang-orang yang paling sesat dan buruk.

Именно так Он поступил, чтобы отвергнуть ложные обвинения в безумии и помешательстве, обращенные в адрес Пророка Мухаммада, ﷺ.\nЭти обвинения были лживыми, потому что по Своей милости Аллах даровал Пос- ланнику, ﷺ, совершенный ум и наделил его мудростью мысли и красноречием. А учение, которое он проповедовал, и по сей день является лучшим из того, что когда-либо изучали и записывали люди.

Люди легко находили с ним общий язык, и он всегда охотно принимал их приглашения. Пророк никогда не отказывал в помощи нуждающимся и всеми силами пытался утешить тех, кто искал утешения. Он не позволял себе лишить человека доброй надежды и разо- чаровать его своим отказом.\nКогда его сподвижники испрашивали его позволения начать какое-либо де- ло, то он благословлял их и даже помогал им, если только это не было сопряжено с грехом. Когда же он принимал решение, то не проявлял самовластия, а совето- вался со своими сподвижниками и обсуждал с ними свои планы.\nПророк, ﷺ, радушно встречал благодеяния своих сторонников и прощал им\nих ошибки. Общаясь с собеседником, он был приветлив и не прекращал беседы первым. Он не хмурился и не был грубым при разговоре. Если ему что-то было приятно, то он не скрывал своей радости.

দ্বারা ঐ বড় মাছকে বুঝানো হয়েছে যা এক জগত পরিবেষ্টনকারী পানির উপর রয়েছে যা সপ্ত আকাশকে উঠিয়ে নিয়ে আছে। যেমন মুসনাদে আহমাদে হযরত ইবনে আব্বাস (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, তিনি বলেনঃ “সর্বপ্রথম আল্লাহ তা'আলা কলম সৃষ্টি করেন এবং ওকে বলেনঃ “লিখো।” কলম বলেঃ “কি লিখবো?” উত্তরে আল্লাহ তা'আলা বলেনঃ “তকদীর লিখে নাও।” সুতরাং ঐ দিন থেকে নিয়ে কিয়ামত পর্যন্ত যা কিছু হবার আছে সবগুলোই কলম লিখে ফেলে। তারপর আল্লাহ পাক মাছ সৃষ্টি করেন এবং পানির বাষ্প উত্থিত করেন যার দ্বারা আকাশ নির্মিত হয় এবং যমীনকে ঐ মাছের পিঠের উপর রাখা হয়। মাছ নড়ে ওঠে, ফলে যমীনও হেলতে দুলতে শুরু করে। তখন আল্লাহ তা’আলা যমীনে পাহাড় গেড়ে দেন। ফলে যমীন মযবূত হয়ে যায় এবং ওর নড়াচড়া করা বন্ধ হয়ে যায়।” অতঃপর হযরত ইবনে আব্বাস (রাঃ) (আরবি)-এ আয়াতটি তিলাওয়াত করেন। (ইমাম ইবনে আবি হাতিম ও (রঃ) এ হাদীসটি বর্ণনা করেছেন) ভাবার্থ এই যে, এখানে (আরবি) দ্বারা এই মাছকেই বুঝানো হয়েছে। হযরত ইবনে আব্বাস (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “আল্লাহ তা'আলা সর্বপ্রথম কলম ও মাছ সষ্টি করেন। কলম জিজ্ঞেস করেঃ “কি লিখবো?” উত্তরে বলা হয়ঃ “কিয়ামত পর্যন্ত যতকিছু হবে সবই লিখে নাও।” অতঃপর তিনি (আরবি)-এ আয়াতটি পাঠ করেন।” (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম তিবরানী (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেন) সুতরাং (আরবি) দ্বারা উদ্দেশ্য মাছ এবং (আরবি) দ্বারা উদ্দেশ্য এই কলম।হযরত আবূ হুরাইরা (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, তিনি রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-কে বলতে শুনেছেনঃ “আল্লাহ তা'আলা সর্বপ্রথম কলম সৃষ্টি করেন। তারপর নূন অর্থাৎ দোয়াত সৃষ্টি করেন। অতঃপর আল্লাহ তা'আলা কলমকে বলেনঃ “লিখো।” কলম বলেঃ “কি লিখবো?” উত্তরে আল্লাহ বলেনঃ “যা কিছু হচ্ছে এবং যা কিছু হবে যেমন আমল, রিযিক, বয়স, মৃত্যু ইত্যাদি সবকিছুই লিখে নাও।” তখন কলম ওগুলো লিখে নেয়।” (এ হাদীসটি ইবনে আসাকির (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন) এই আয়াত দ্বারা উদ্দেশ্য এটাই। অতঃপর কলমের উপর মোহর লাগিয়ে দেয়া হয়। সুতরাং কিয়ামত পর্যন্ত ওটা আর চলবে না। তারপর আল্লাহ তা'আলা জ্ঞান বা বিবেক সৃষ্টি করেন এবং ওকে বলেনঃ “আমার মর্যাদার শপথ! আমার বন্ধুদের মধ্যে আমি তোমাকে পূর্ণতায় পৌঁছিয়ে দিবো এবং আমার শক্রদের মধ্যে তোমাকে অপূর্ণ রাখবো।” মুজাহিদ (রঃ) বলেনঃ এটা মশহুর ছিল যে, নূন দ্বারা ঐ মাছকে বুঝানো হয়েছে যা সপ্তম যমীনের নীচে রয়েছে। বাগাভী (রঃ) প্রমুখ তাফসীরকার বলেন যে, এই মাছের পিঠের উপর এক কংকরময় ভূমি রয়েছে যার পুরুত্ব আকাশ ও পৃথিবীর সমান। ওর উপর একটি বলদ রয়েছে যার চল্লিশ হাজার শিং রয়েছে। ওর পিঠের উপর সাতটি যমীন এবং ওগুলোর সমস্ত মাখলূক আছে। এসব ব্যাপারে আল্লাহ তা'আলাই সবচেয়ে ভাল জানেন। বড়ই বিস্ময়কর ব্যাপার এই যে, কতক মুফাসসির এই হাদীসকেও এই অর্থের উপরই স্থাপন করেছেন যা মুসনাদে আহমাদ প্রভৃতি হাদীস গ্রন্থে রয়েছে। তা এই যে, হযরত আবদুল্লাহ ইবনে সালাম (রাঃ) যখন রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-এর মদীনায় আগমনের সংবাদ অবগত হন তখন তিনি তাঁর নিকট হাযির হন এবং কতকগুলো প্রশ্ন করেন। তিনি তাকে বলেনঃ “আমি আপনাকে এমন কতকগুলো প্রশ্ন করবো যেগুলো নবীগণ ছাড়া অন্য কেউ জানে না।” অতঃপর তিনি প্রশ্ন করেনঃ “কিয়ামতের প্রথম নিদর্শন কি? জান্নাতীদের প্রথম খাদ্য কি? কি কারণে সন্তান কখনো পিতার দিকে আকর্ষিত হয় এবং কখনো মাতার দিকে আকর্ষিত হয়?” রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) উত্তরে বলেনঃ “এই কথাগুলো এখনই হযরত জিবরাঈল (আঃ) আমাকে বলে গেলেন।” তখন হযরত ইবনে সালাম (রাঃ) বলে উঠলেনঃ “ ফেরেশতাদের মধ্যেই তিনি এমন একজন ফেরেশতা যিনি ইয়াহূদীদের দুশমন।\" রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বললেনঃ “কিয়ামতের প্রথম নিদর্শন হলো এমন এক আগুন বের হওয়া যা লোকদেরকে পূর্ব দিক হতে পশ্চিম দিকে নিয়ে যাবে। আর জান্নাতীদের প্রথম খাদ্য হলো মাছের কলিজার অতিরিক্ততা। পুরুষের বীর্য স্ত্রীর বীর্যের উপর প্রাধান্য লাভ করলে পুত্র সন্তান হয় এবং যখন স্ত্রীর বীর্য স্বামীর বীর্যের উপর প্রাধান্য লাভ করে তখন কন্যা সন্তান হয়।\"অন্য হাদীসে এটুকু বেশী আছে যে, হযরত আবদুল্লাহ ইবনে সালাম প্রশ্ন করেনঃ “এই খাদ্যের পরে জান্নাতীদেরকে কি খেতে দেয়া হবে?” উত্তরে রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেনঃ “জান্নাতী বলদ যবেহ করা হবে যা জান্নাতে চরে বেড়াতো।” তারপর জিজ্ঞেস করেনঃ “তাদেরকে কোন পানি পান করানো হবে?” রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) জবাবে বলেনঃ “সালসাবীল' নামক নহর হতে তাদেরকে পান করানো হবে।” একথাও বলা হয়েছে যে, (আরবি) দ্বারা আলোর তক্তা উদ্দেশ্য। একটি মুরসাল গারীব হাদীসে রয়েছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) এ আয়াতটি পাঠ করে বলেনঃ “এর দ্বারা উদ্দেশ্য হলো নূরের তক্তা এবং নূরের কলম যা চালিত হয়েছে। এমন সব জিনিসের উপর যেগুলো কিয়ামত পর্যন্ত হতে থাকবে।” ইবনে জুরায়েজ (রঃ) বলেনঃ আমাকে খবর দেয়া হয়েছে যে, ওটা এমন একটি নূরানী কলম যার দৈর্ঘ্য একশ বছরের পথ। একথাও বলা হয়েছে যে, (আরবি) দ্বারা দোয়াত এবং (আরবি) দ্বারা কলম কে বুঝানো হয়েছে। হাসান (রঃ) এবং কাতাদাহও (রঃ) একথাই বলেছেন। একটি অত্যন্ত গারীব বা দুর্বল মার হাদীসেও এটা বর্ণিত হয়েছে। যা মুসনাদে ইবনে হাতিমে রয়েছে যে, আল্লাহ তা’আলা (আরবি) অর্থাৎ দোয়াত সৃষ্টি করেন। হযরত ইবনে আব্বাস (রাঃ) বলেন যে, আল্লাহ দোয়াত ও কলম সৃষ্টি করেন। তারপর কলমকে বলেনঃ “লিখো।” কলম প্রশ্ন করেঃ “কি লিখবো?” আল্লাহ তা'আলা উত্তরে বলেনঃ “কিয়ামত পর্যন্ত যা কিছু হবে ওগুলো লিখো। যেমন আমল সমূহ, ভালই হোক আর মন্দই হোক, রিযিক, তা হালালই হোক অথবা হারামই হোক। তারপর এও লিখোঃ কোন জিনিস দুনিয়ায় কখন আসবে, কতদিন থাকবে এবং কখন বের হবে? আর আল্লাহ তা’আলা বান্দাদের উপর রক্ষক ফেরেশতাদেরকে নিয়োগ করেছেন এবং কিতাবের জন্যে দারোগা নিযুক্ত করেছেন। রক্ষক ফেরেশতাগণ প্রতিদিনের আমল সম্পর্কে দারোগাকে জিজ্ঞেস করে লিখে নেন। যখন রিযিক শেষ হয়ে যায়, আয়ু পূর্ণ হয় এবং মৃত্যুর সময় এসে পড়ে তখন রক্ষক ফেরেশতাগণ দারোগা ফেরেশতাদের নিকট এসে জিজ্ঞেস করেনঃ “বলুন, আজকের আমল কি আছে?\" তারা উত্তরে বলেনঃ “এই ব্যক্তির জন্যে এখন আমাদের কাছে কিছুই নেই।\" একথা শুনে এই ফেরেশতাগণ নীচে নেমে আসেন এবং দেখেন যে, ঐ ব্যক্তি মারা গেছে। হযরত ইবনে আব্বাস (রাঃ) এটা বর্ণনা করার পর বলেন, তোমরা তো আরব সম্প্রদায়, তোমরা কি কুরআন কারীমে রক্ষক ফেরেশতাদের সম্পর্কে পড় নি? বলা হয়েছেঃ (আরবি) অর্থাৎ তোমরা যা আমল করতে তা আমরা লিখে রাখতাম।” ভাবার্থ হচ্ছেঃ তোমাদের আমলগুলো আমরা মূল হতে লিখে নিতাম। (৪৫:২৯)এতো হলো (আরবি) শব্দ সম্পর্কে বর্ণনা। এখন (আরবি) শব্দ সম্পর্কে বর্ণনা দেয়া হচ্ছে। বাহ্যতঃ এখানে (আরবি) দ্বারা সাধারণ কলম উদ্দেশ্য, যা দ্বারা লিখা হয়। যেমন আল্লাহ পাকের উক্তিঃ (আরবি)অর্থাৎ “পাঠ কর, আর তোমার প্রতিপালক মহামহিমান্বিত, যিনি কলমের সাহায্যে শিক্ষা দিয়েছেন- শিক্ষা দিয়েছেন মানুষকে, যা সে জানতো না।” (৯৬:৩-৫)এই কলমের কসম খেয়ে আল্লাহ তাবারাকা ওয়া তা'আলা এটা অবহিত করছেন যে, তিনি মানুষকে লিখন শিক্ষা দিয়েছেন যার মাধ্যমে তারা ইলম বা জ্ঞান অর্জন করছে, এটাও তাঁর একটা বড় নিয়ামত। এজন্যেই এরপরই তিনি বলেনঃ এবং কসম তার যা তারা লিপিবদ্ধ করে। হযরত ইবনে আব্বাস (রাঃ), হযরত মুজাহিদ (রঃ) এবং হযরত কাতাদাহ (রঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, ভাবার্থ হচ্ছেঃ শপথ ঐ জিনিসের যা তারা লিখে। হযরত ইবনে আব্বাস (রাঃ) হতে এও বর্ণিত আছে যে, এর ভাবার্থ হলোঃ শপথ ঐ জিনিসের যা তারা জানে। হযরত সুদ্দী (রঃ) বলেন যে, এর দ্বারা ফেরেশতাদের লিখনকে বুঝানো হয়েছে, যারা বান্দাদের আমল লিখে থাকেন। অন্যান্য তাফসীরকারগণ বলেন যে, এর দ্বারা ঐ কলমকে বুঝানো হয়েছে যা কুদরতীরূপে চালিত হয়েছে এবং আসমান ও যমীন সৃষ্টির পঞ্চাশ হাজার বছর পূর্বে তকদীর লিপিবদ্ধ করেছে। তারা এর অনুকূলে ঐ হাদীস দু’টি পেশ করেছেন যা কলমের বর্ণনায় বর্ণিত হয়েছে। হযরত মুজাহিদ (রঃ) বলেন যে, এর দ্বারা ঐ কলম উদ্দেশ্য যার দ্বারা যিকির লিখিত হয়েছে। এরপর আল্লাহ তা’আলা স্বীয় নবী (সঃ)-কে বলেনঃ তুমি তোমার প্রতিপালকের অনুগ্রহে পাগল নও, যেমন তোমার সম্প্রদায়ের মূখ ও সত্য অস্বীকারকারীরা তোমাকে বলে থাকে। বরং তোমার জন্যে অবশ্যই রয়েছে নিরবচ্ছিন্ন পুরস্কার। কেননা, তুমি রিসালাতের দায়িত্ব পূর্ণরূপে পালন করেছে। এবং আমার পথে অসহনীয় কষ্ট সহ্য করেছে। তাই আমি তোমাকে বে-হিসাব পুরস্কার প্রদান করবো। তুমি অবশ্যই মহান চরিত্রের অধিকারী।হযরত ইবনে আব্বাস (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, (আরবি) –এর অর্থ হলো (আরবি) অর্থাৎ মহান দ্বীন এবং তা হলো দ্বীন ইসলাম। মুজাহিদ (রঃ), আবূ মালিক (রঃ), সুদ্দী (রঃ) এবং রবী ইবনে আনাস (রঃ) একথাই বলেছেন। যহহাক (রঃ) এবং ইবনে যায়েদও (রঃ) এরূপই বলেছেন। আতিয়্যাহ (রঃ) বলেন যে, (আরবি) দ্বারা (আরবি) বা উত্তম শিষ্টাচার বুঝানো হয়েছে। হযরত কাতাদাহ্ (রঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, হযরত আয়েশা (রাঃ)-কে রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-এর চরিত্র সম্পর্কে প্রশ্ন করা হলে তিনি বলেনঃ “তাঁর চরিত্র হলো কুরআন (অর্থাৎ কুরআনেই তাঁর চরিত্রের বর্ণনা দেয়া হয়েছে)।অন্য হাদীসে রয়েছে যে, হযরত আয়েশা (রাঃ) উত্তরে বলেনঃ “তুমি কি কুরআন পড়নি?” প্রশ্নকারী হযরত সাঈদ ইবনে হিশাম (রাঃ) বলেনঃ “হ্যাঁ, পড়েছি।” তখন হযরত আয়েশা (রাঃ) বলেনঃ “কুরআন কারীমই তাঁর চরিত্র ছিল।\" সহীহ্ মুসলিমে এ হাদীসটি পূর্ণরূপে বর্ণিত হয়েছে যা আমরা ইনশাআল্লাহ্ সূরা মুযযাম্মিলের তাফসীরে বর্ণনা করবো। বানু সাওয়াদ গোত্রের একটি লোক হযরত আয়েশা (রাঃ)-কে রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-এর চরিত্র সম্পর্কে জিজ্ঞেস করলে তিনি উপরোক্ত উত্তর দেন এবং (আরবি) –এ আয়াতটি পাঠ করেন। তখন ঐ লোকটি তাকে বলেনঃ “দু' একটি ঘটনা বর্ণনা করুন!” তখন হযরত আয়েশা (রাঃ) বলেনঃ “তাহলে শুননা! একদা রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-এর জন্যে আমি এবং হযরত হাফসা (রাঃ) উভয়েই খাদ্য রান্না করি। আমি আমার দাসীকে বলিঃ দেখো, যদি আমার খাদ্যের পূর্বে হাফসা (রাঃ)-এর খাদ্য এসে পড়ে তবে তুমি তা ফেলে দিবে। আমার দাসী তাই করে এবং খাদ্যের পাত্রটিও ভেঙ্গে যায়। রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) ছড়িয়ে পড়া বিক্ষিপ্ত খাদ্যগুলো একত্রিত করেন এবং বলেনঃ “এই পাত্রের পরিবর্তে একটি ভাল পাত্র তাকে তুমি দাও।” আল্লাহর শপথ! এ ছাড়া আর কোন শাসন গর্জন ও তিরস্কার ভৎসনা তিনি আমাকে করেননি।\" (এ হাদীসটি মুসনাদে আহমাদে বর্ণিত হয়েছে)এ হাদীসটি যে কয়েক ধারায় বিভিন্ন শব্দে কয়েকটি কিতাবে বর্ণিত হয়েছে তার একটি ভাবার্থ তো এই যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-এর প্রকৃতিতে জন্মগতভাবেই আল্লাহ তা'আলা পছন্দনীয় চরিত্র, উত্তম স্বভাব এবং পবিত্র অভ্যাস সৃষ্টি করে রেখেছিলেন। সুতরাং এভাবেই কুরআন কারীমের উপর তাঁর আমল এমনই ছিল যে, তিনি যেন ছিলেন কুরআনের আহকামের মূর্তিমান আমলী নমুনা। প্রত্যেকটি হুকুম পালনে এবং প্রত্যেকটি নিষিদ্ধ বিষয় হতে বিরত থাকাতে তাঁর অবস্থা এই ছিল যে, কুরআনে যা কিছু রয়েছে তা যেন তাঁরই অভ্যাস ও মহৎ চরিত্রের বর্ণনা। হযরত আনাস (রাঃ) বলেনঃ “দশ বছর ধরে আমি রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-এর খিদমতে থেকেছি কিন্তু তিনি কোন এক দিনের তরেও আমাকে উহ (যন্ত্রণা প্রকাশক ধ্বনি) পর্যন্ত বলেননি। কোন করণীয় কাজ না করলেও এবং যা করণীয় নয় তা করে বসলেও তিনি আমাকে কোন শাসন গর্জন করা এবং ধমক দেয়া তো দূরের কথা এরূপ কেন হলো?' এ কথাটিও বলেননি। তিনি সবারই চেয়ে বেশী চরিত্রবান ছিলেন। তাঁর হাতের তালুর চেয়ে বেশী নরম আমি কোন রেশম অথবা অন্য কোন জিনিস স্পর্শ করিনি। আর তার ঘর্ম অপেক্ষা বেশী সুগন্ধময় জিনিস আমি শুকিনি। মিশক আম্বরও না এবং আতরও না।” (এ হাদীসটি সহীহ বুখারী ও সহীহ মুসলিমে বর্ণিত হয়েছে)হযরত বারা (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) চেহারায় সবচেয়ে সুন্দর ছিলেন, ছিলেন সবচেয়ে চরিত্রবান। তাঁর পবিত্র দেহ খুব লম্বাও ছিল না এবং খুব খাটোও ছিল না। (সহীহ বুখারীতে এ হাদীসটি বর্ণিত) এ সম্পর্কে বহু হাদীস রয়েছে। ইমাম আবূ ঈসা তিরমিযী (রঃ) তাঁর কিতাবুশ শামায়েলে এ সম্পর্কীয় হাদীস বর্ণনা করেছেন। মুসনাদে আহমাদে হযরত আয়েশা (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, তিনি বলেনঃ রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) কখনো তাঁর হাত দ্বারা না তাঁর কোন দাসকে প্রহার করেছেন, না প্রহার করেছেন তাঁর কোন স্ত্রীকে এবং না প্রহার করেছেন অন্য কাউকেও। তবে হ্যাঁ, আল্লাহর পথে জিহাদ করেছেন (এবং ঐ জিহাদে কাউকে মেরেছেন) সেটা অন্য কথা। যখন তাঁকে দু’টি কাজের যে কোন একটিকে অবলম্বন করার অধিকার দেয়া হতো তখন তিনি সহজটি অবলম্বন করতেন। তবে সেটা গুনাহর কাজ হলে তিনি তা থেকে বহু দূরে থাকতেন। কখনো তিনি কারো নিকট হতে কোন প্রতিশোধ গ্রহণ করেননি। তবে কেউ আল্লাহর মর্যাদা ক্ষুন্ন করলে তিনি আল্লাহর আহকাম জারি করার জন্যে অবশ্যই তার নিকট হতে প্রতিশোধ গ্রহণ করতেন, কাজেই এটা ভিন্ন কথা।মুসনাদে আহমাদে হযরত আবূ হুরাইরা (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “নিশ্চয়ই আমি উত্তম ও পবিত্র চরিত্র পরিপূর্ণ বা বাস্তবে রূপায়িত করার জন্যেই প্রেরিত হয়েছি। (অর্থাৎ নিজের জীবনে বাস্তবায়িত করার জন্যেই প্রেরিত হয়েছি)।”এরপর আল্লাহ তা'আলা বলেনঃ হে নবী (সঃ) শীঘ্রই তুমি দেখবে এবং তারাও দেখবে যে, তোমাদের মধ্যে কে বিকারগ্রস্ত। যেমন আল্লাহ পাক অন্য জায়গায় বলেনঃ (আরবি)অর্থাৎ “আগামীকল্য তারা জানবে, কে মিথ্যাবাদী, দাম্ভিক।” (৫৪:২৬) আর এক জায়গায় বলেনঃ  (আরবি)অর্থাৎ “আমরা অথবা তোমরা অবশ্যই হিদায়াতের উপর কিংবা প্রকাশ্য বিভ্রান্তির মধ্যে রয়েছি।” (৩৪:২৪) হযরত ইবনে আব্বাস (রাঃ) বলেনঃ অর্থাৎ এই হকীকত বা তত্ত্ব কিয়ামতের দিন খুলে যাবে। হযরত ইবনে আব্বাস (রাঃ) হতেই এটাও বর্ণিত আছে যে, (আরবি) বলা হয় (আরবি) বা পাগলকে। হযরত মুজাহিদ (রঃ) প্রমুখ মনীষীও একথাই বলেন। হযরত কাতাদাহ (রঃ) প্রমুখ গুরুজন বলেন যে, এর ভাবার্থ হচ্ছেঃ তুমি শীঘ্রই জানতে পারবে কে বেশী শয়তানের নিকটবর্তী। (আরবি) এর বাহ্যিক অর্থ এই যে, যে ব্যক্তি সত্য হতে সরে পড়ে এবং পথভ্রষ্ট হয়ে যায়। (আরবি) এর উপর (আরবি) আনয়নের কারণ এই যে, যেন তা (আরবি) প্রমাণ করে। অর্থাৎ এর প্রকৃতরূপ ছিলঃ (আরবি) অর্থাৎ ‘শীঘ্রই তুমি জানবে এবং তারাও জানবে’ অথবা এইরূপ ছিলঃ (আরবি) অর্থাৎ ‘তোমাদের মধ্যে কে বিকারগ্রস্ত তা শীঘ্রই তুমিও খবর দিবে এবং তারাও খবর দিবে।' এসব ব্যাপারে আল্লাহ তা’আলাই সবচেয়ে ভাল জানেন।এরপর আল্লাহ তাবারাকা ওয়া তা'আলা বলেনঃ তোমার প্রতিপালক তো সম্যক অবগত আছেন কে তাঁর পথ হতে বিচ্যুত হয়েছে এবং তিনি সম্যক জানেন তাদেরকে যারা সৎপথ প্রাপ্ত। অর্থাৎ কারা সৎপথের উপর প্রতিষ্ঠিত রয়েছে এবং কাদের পদস্খলন ঘটেছে তা আল্লাহ তা'আলা সম্যক অবগত।</p>"

Bu yeminin sebebi, kalemin ve onunla satır satır yazılan türlü sözlerin, Allah’ın pek büyük âyetlerinden olmasıdır. Bu da peygamberi Muhammed sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem’in düşmanlarının ona nispet ettikleri delilikten uzak olduğuna dair kendisi ile yemin edilmeye değer bir şeydir. \n2. Alah onun, Rabbinin üzerindeki nimet ve ihsanı sayesinde delilikten çok uzak olduğunu bildirmektedir. Çünkü Allah, ona kemâl derecesindeki aklı, oldukça sağlam görüşü ve kalemlerin yazdığı şeylerin, insanların satır satır dizdiklerinin en güzeli olan, hakkı batıldan ayırt edici sözü ona ihsan etmiştir. İşte bu, dünyadaki mutluluğun tâ kendisidir.                </p><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        3. Daha sonra Allah,<span class=\"blue\"> onun âhiretteki mutluluğunu da söz konusu ederek:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Gerçekten senin için kesintisiz bir mükafat vardır”</span> buyurmaktadır. Yan senin için pek büyük bir mükafat vardır. Nitekim “mükafat” kelimesinin <span class=\"green\">(لَأَجۡرًا )</span> nekire/belirtisiz gelmesi de bunu ifade etmektedir. Bu mükafatın kesintisi olmayacaktır. Sürekli ve devamlıdır. Buna sebep de Peygamber sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem’in işlemiş olduğu salih ameller, sahip olduğu mükemmel ahlâk ve her türlü hayra yol gösterişidir.<span class=\"blue\"> Bundan dolayı Yüce Allah şöyle buyurmaktadır:</span>\n</div><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        4. <span class=\"brown\">“Şüphe yok ki sen çok yüce bir ahlâka sahipsin.”</span> Ahlâkın pek yücedir, Allah’ın sana lütfetmiş olduğu ahlâk ile sen, alabildiğine yükseklere çıkmışsın.\nO’nun pek yüce olan bu ahlâkının özünü mü’minlerin annesi Âişe radıyallahu anha dile getirmiştir.<span class=\"blue\"> Zira Peygamber’in ahlâkı hakkında kendisine soru soranlara:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Onun ahlâkı Kur’ân idi”</span> diyerek cevap vermiştir.<span class=\"blue\">\nNitekim Yüce Allah’ın şu buyrukları da buna örnektir:</span><span class=\"brown\">“Sen af yolunu tut, mâruf olanı emret ve cahillerden yüz çevir!”</span><span class=\"green\">(el-A’râf, 7/199)</span>; <span class=\"brown\">“Allah’tan bir rahmet sayesinde sen onlara yumuşak davrandın...”</span><span class=\"green\">(Âl-i İmrân, 3/159)</span>; “Andolsun içinizden size öyle bir peygamber gelmiştir ki sizin sıkıntıya uğramanız ona pek ağır gelir... “ <span class=\"green\">(et-Tevbe, 9/128)</span> Buna benzer Peygamber sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem’in en üstün ahlâkî değerlere sahip olduğunu gösteren daha pek çok âyet-i kerime ile her türlü güzel ahlâka teşvik eden âyet-i kerimeler hep bu türdendir.\nZira o bütün bu ahlâkî faziletlerin en mükemmel ve en değerlisine sahipti. Her bir ahlâkî fazilette en yüksek zirveye çıkmıştı. Gâyet yumuşak huylu idi. İnsanlara yakındı, davet edenlerin davetini kabul ederdi. Bir ihtiyacını karşılamasını isteyenin ihtiyacını görürdü. Kendisinden bir şeyler isteyenin gönlünü ederdi. Onu mahrum etmez ve eli boş çevirmezdi. Arkadaşları ondan bir işi yapmasını istediklerinde onlara muvafakat eder, eğer bir sakıncası yoksa bu konuda onlara uyardı. Bir işe karar verdiği takdirde bunu tek başına alıp onlara dayatmazdı. Aksine onlara danışır ve görüşlerini alırdı. İyilikte bulunanların bu davranışlarını kabul ile karşılar, kötülük işleyeni affederdi. Kiminle oturup kalkmış ve sohbette bulunmuşsa mutlaka ona en güzel ve en mükemmel şekilde davranmıştır. Ona karşı yüzünü ekşitmez, konuştuğu vakit sert ve kaba konuşmazdı. Ona gülümsemeyi esirgemez, yanılarak söylediği sözleri saklayıp yüzüne vurmazdı. Herhangi bir olumsuz davranışı dolayısı ile onu azarlamaz, aksine onlara alabildiğine iyilikte bulunur ve en ileri bir derecede onlara katlanırdı.                </div><div lang=\"tr\" class=\"tr \">\n                                        5-6.

تعریف وثنا میں پوری کائنات شریک ہوجاتی ہے اور اس پوری کائنات کی روح کے اندر یہ بات ثابت ہوجاتی ہے کہ آپ خلق عظیم کے مالک تھے۔</p><p>کسی قلم میں یہ قوت نہیں ہے کہ وہ آپ کے مناقب بیان کرسکے ، کسی شخص میں یہ قوت نہیں ہے کہ وہ آپ کے اخلاق کا تصور کرسکے۔ اور اس عظیم سرٹیفکیٹ کی تشریح کرسکے۔ یہ عظیم کلمات رب عظیم کی طرف سے ہیں۔ اور رب تعالیٰ اپنی اس عظیم شہادت کی تشریح کرسکتا ہے۔ اللہ کے ہاں عظمت کے کیا پیمانے ہیں ، اس کا بندہ کس قدر عظیم ہے ، یہ وہی جانتا ہے ۔ جس نے کہا :</p><p>وانک لعلی ................ عظیم (86 : 4) ” اور بیشک تم اخلاق کے بڑے مرتبے پر ہو “۔ یہ خلق عظیم وہ ہے جس کا تصور کسی انسان کے لئے ممکن نہیں ہے کہ وہ اپنی محدود عقل وادراک سے اس کا تصور کرسکے۔ لیکن مختلف پہلوﺅں سے آپ کے اخلاق ” عظیم “ تھے۔</p><p>سب سے پہلا پہلو تو یہ ہے کہ یہ بات اللہ تعالیٰ کی طرف سے آرہی ہے۔ رب تعالیٰ آپ کو خلق عظیم کا لقب عطا فرمارہا ہے۔ اس میں اللہ کی مخلوق اور اس کی ناپیداکنار کائنات بھی شامل ہے۔ اور ملاء اعلیٰ کی تمام مخلوقات جو رب تعالیٰ کی کائنات کے کارندے ہیں ، سب اس میں شامل ہیں۔</p><p>آپ کے خلق عظیم کا ایک پہلو یہ ہے کہ آپ نے یہ ربانی شہادت حاصل کی۔ اپنے رب کی طرف سے حاصل کی۔ یہ جانتے ہوئے کہ اس عظیم کائنات کا عظیم باری تعالیٰ یہ کہہ رہا ہے ” یہ ایک بہت اعزاز ہے “۔ ان کلمات کا ایک عظیم مفہوم ہے ، ان کی ایک وسعت ہے ، ان کی ایک بلند گونج ہے۔ آپ جانتے تھے کہ کس عظیم ذات کی ہے یہ شہادت اور یہ شہادت کیس قدر عظیم ہے۔</p><p>یہ محمد ﷺ ہی کا ظرف تھا جو اس عظیم شہادت کو قبول کرنے کی طاقت رکھتا تھا۔ صرف آپ ہی کا حوصلہ تھا کہ اس عظیم مصدر سے یہ شہادت پائے اور سنجیدگی کے ساتھ اپنی جگہ اور مقام پر قائم رہے۔ اور اس عظیم شہادت کے دباﺅ اور اثر کو برداشت کرسکے۔ یہ ایک تعریف تھی لیکن آپ کی ذات کے اندر کوئی حرکت ، کوئی اضطراب پیدا نہ ہوا۔ نہایت اطمینان ، نہایت توازن اور سنجیدگی کے ساتھ آپ نے یہ اعزاز لیا۔ اور آپ کی عظمت کی بڑی دلیل یہ ہے کہ آپ نے اس عظیم خطاب کے بوجھ کو اٹھا لیا۔</p><p>آپ کے خلق عظیم کی روایات سے سیرت کی کتب بھری ہیں۔ آپ کے صحابی اس مضمون پر رطب اللسان ہیں اور خودآپ کا برتاﺅ ہی ایک بڑی شہادت ہے ، اس بات کی۔ لیکن رب تعالیٰ کی طرف سے یہ عظیم اعزاز عظیم تر ہے۔ یہ علی کبیر اور رب متعال کی طرف سے ہے۔ اور پھر اس سے بھی عظیم تر یہ بات ہے کہ خالق کائنات کی طرف سے یہ عظیم شہادت پاکر آپ سنجیدہ ، مطمئن ، مضبوط اور اپنے مقام پر جمے رہے۔ آپ نے انسانوں پر اپنی برتری نہیں جتائی ، آپ نے علو اختیار نہیں کیا ، بڑائی اختیار نہیں کی اور آپ نے اسے ہضم کرلیا اور آپ کا انکسار وہی رہا۔ حالانکہ یہ بہت ہی عظیم اعزاز تھا۔</p><p>اللہ جانتا ہے کہ وہ کس کو رسول بنارہا ہے۔ حضرت محمد ﷺ اپنی اس عظمت کے باوجود .... رسول تھے اور اپنی اس کائناتی عظمت کے باوجود رسالت کی ذمہ داریاں اٹھا رہے تھے اور لوگوں کے سامنے ایک انسان کی طرح عظمت اخلاق کا نمونہ پیش فرماتے تھے۔</p><p>یہ آخری رسالت جس قدر کامل اور جمیل ہے ، جس پدر عظیم اور جامع ہے ، جس قدر حق اور سچی ہے ، اس کا حامل وہی شخص ہوسکتا تھا ، جس کو خالق کائنات یہ لقب دے کہ تم خلق عظیم پر ہو۔ اور پھر آپ کی شخصیت کو بھی یہ قوت دی گئی کہ وہ اس عظمت کو وصول کرسکے۔ اور متوازن اور سنجیدہ رہے۔ ایک عظیم انسان کی طرح مطمئن رہے۔ ایک عظیم شخص ہی اس عظمت کو اٹھاسکتا ہے جو ان الفاظ میں دی گئی ہے۔ اس عظیم ثنا اور تعریف کے بعد قرآن میں بعض اوقات آپ پر عتاب بھی آیا ہے ، لیکن آپ نے اسے بھی نہایت ہی عظمت کے ساتھ سنا ہے۔ نہایت توازن اور اطمینان کے ساتھ۔ جس طرح آپ کو اس عظمت کا اعلان ہوا۔ اسی طرح آپ کو تنبیہ کرنے والی آیات کو بھی اس لازوال کتاب میں جگہ دی گئی ہے۔ اللہ نے کوئی بات چھپا کر نہیں رکھی۔ اور دونوں حالات میں نبی آخرالزمان عظیم رہے۔ آپ نے دونوں باتوں کو عظمت کے ساتھ لیا۔</p><p>نفس محمدی کی حقیقت دراصل رسالت محمدی کے اندر پوشیدہ ہے ، اور عظمت محمد ﷺ کا پیمانہ رسالت محمدیہ کی عظمت ہے۔ اور حقیقت محمدیہ یہ حقیقت دین اسلام کی طریح انسان کے ادراک سے اور انسان کے مشاہدے سے اس طرح دور ہے جس طرح اس کائنات میں کوئی کہکشاں دور ہے۔ ایک شخص رصدگاہ میں بیٹھ کر دور سے اس کی طرف اشارہ تو کرسکتا ہے لیکن کسی کے لئے حقیقت محمدیہ کا احاطہ کرنا ممکن نہیں ہے۔ کیونکہ یہ حقیقت انسان کے مشاہدے اور ادراک سے بہت دور ہے۔ انسان ایک کہکشاں کی طرح دور سے اس کی طرف اشارہ تو کرسکتا ہے لیکن وہ اس کے بارے میں پوری بات نہیں کرسکتا۔</p><p>میں ایک بار پھر یہ نکتہ اٹھاتا ہوں اور اس سوچ میں پڑا ہوں کہ حقیقت محمدیہ نے کس قدر عظیم اعزاز پایا اور اسے اپنایا اور آپ کی شخصیت متوازن ، ثابت قدم اور مطمئن رہی۔ آپ بہرحال انسان تو تھے۔ کبھی جب آپ اپنے کسی رفیق کی تعریف فرماتے تو آپ کا وہ رفیق اور اس کے دوست یار خوشی کے مارے پھولے نہ سماتے۔ اس کا ان پر اس قدر اثر ہوتا کہ قریب تھا کہ ان کی شادی مرگ سے دو چار ہونا پڑے۔ باوجود اسکے کہ آپ بشر تھے۔ آپ کے ساتھی جانتے تھے کہ آپ بشر ہیں۔ اور آپ نبی ہیں اور نبوت کا ایک معلوم دائرہ ہوتا ہے۔ نبی بشر ہوتا ہے لیکن حضور اکرم ﷺ کا معاملہ اور ہے۔ آپ کے حق میں تو شہادت رب کائنات دے رہا ہے۔ آپ جانتے ہیں کہ رب کائنات کس قدر عظیم ہے۔ اور اگر کوئی نہیں جانتا تو حقیقت محمدیہ تو رب کائنات کی عظمت کو خوب جانتی ہے۔ لیکن اس کے باوجود آپ اس عظیم شہادت کو نہایت سنجیدگی سے ہی لیتے ہیں اور اپنی روش میں کوئی فرق آنے نہیں دیتے۔ یہ ہے اصل عظمت اور یہ ہے وہ بات ، جوہر اندازے سے بلند ہے۔</p><p>حضرت محمد ﷺ وحدہ اس مقام تک پہنچے ہیں ، اس عظمت کے مقام تک۔ یہ عظمت و کمال کی بلند چوٹی ہے جس کو آپ نے صرف آپ نے سر کیا ہے۔ اس مقام تک کوئی اور انسان نہیں پہنچ سکا اور یہ حقیقت محمدیہ تھی جو اس رسالت کے اٹھانے کے اہل ہوئی جو کائناتی رسالت ہے ، ابدی رسالت ہے ، اور عالمی انسانی رسالت ہے۔ یہ رسالت آپ کی شخصیت میں مشخص ہوئی اور عملی شکل میں انسانیت کو ملی۔ یہ آخری رسالت اسی طرح آئی کہ مکہ اور مدینہ میں انسانی شکل میں پھرتی رہی۔ یہ تھے محمد ﷺ۔ اس مقام کے اہل اور اللہ ہی جانتا تھا کہ اس مقام کا اہل اس کی مخلوق میں سے کون ہے ؟ اس لئے اس نے اعلان فرمایا کہ</p><p>وانک ................ عظیم (86 : 4) ” اللہ نے بذات خود یہ اعلان کیا اور اعلان فرمایا کہ اللہ خود حضرت محمد ﷺ پر صلوٰة وسلام بھیجتا ہے۔ اور یہ اللہ ہی کی بخشش ہے جو کسی انسان کو عطا کرتا ہے۔ یہ رتبہ بلند ہے جس کو مل گیا۔</p><p>پھر اس شہادت کا ایک دوسرا پہلو بھی ہے ، اور وہ یہ ہے کہ اسلامی نقطہ نظر سے انسانی نظام کے اندر اخلاق کی اہمیت کیا ہے۔ اسلامی نظام حیات میں حسن اخلاق ہر معاملے میں ایک بنیادی عنصر ہے۔</p><p>اسلامی نظریہ حیات کا مطالعہ کریں یا نبی آخرالزمان کی سیرت کا مطالعہ کریں ، نظر آئے گا کہ ان میں بنیادی عنصر اسلامی اخلاق کا ہے۔ اسی اخلاقی عنصر پر اسلام کا تہذیبی اور قانونی نظام قائم ہے۔ اس نظام میں طہارت ، نظافت ، امانت ، سچائی ، عدل ، رحم دلی ، نیکی ، وعدہ وفائی ، قول وفعل کے درمیان مطابقت ، نیت اور ضمیر کے درمیان مطابقت ، ظلم اور زیادتی کی مخالفت ، ظلم اور دھوکہ بازی کی ممانعت ، لوگوں کا مال باطل طریقے سے کھانے کی ممانعت ، لوگوں کی عزت پر حملے کی ممانعت ، فحاشی کے ارتکاب اور فحاشی کی اشاعت کی ممانعت ، خواہ وہ جس شکل میں بھی ہو۔ اور اس نظام میں جس قدر قانون سازی بھی کی گئی ہے وہ ان اخلاقیات میں سے کسی نہ کسی اخلاق کی حفاظت کے لئے کی گئی ہے اور اس قانون سازی کے ذریعہ لوگوں کے سلوک ، ان کے شعور اور طرز عمل میں اخلاقی قدریں پیدا کرنے کی سعی کی گئی ہے۔ اور یہ اخلاقیات بیک وقت انفرادی ، اجتماعی اور بین الاقوامی طرز عمل میں ملحوظ رکھے گئے ہیں۔</p><p>رسول اللہ ﷺ کا فرمان ہے : ” مجھے اس لئے بھیجا گیا کہ میں مکارم اخلاق کی تکمیل کردوں “۔ آپ نے اپنی بعثت کا مقصد اخلاقی تطہیر کے اندر محدود کردیا۔ اور احادیث کا ایک زمزمہ بہہ رہا ہے کہ خلق حسن اختیار کرو ، کریمانہ انداز اپناﺅ، آپ کی سیرت طیبہ اس کی ایک مثال ہے اور ایک صاف صفحہ ہے۔ اور ایک اعلیٰ تصویر ہے مکارم اخلاق کی۔ اور فی الواقعہ آپ اس بات کے مستحق تھے کہ خالق کائنات یہ شہادت دے کہ وانک ................ عظیم (86 : 4) جس طرح حضور اکرم ﷺ خلق عظیم کے اعلیٰ درجے پر ہیں اسی طرح آپ کا پیش کردہ اسلامی نظام حیات بھی اعلیٰ اخلاقی قدروں کا حامل ہے۔ اس اخلاق کے ذریعہ زمین کی بستیوں کو آسمانوں سے ملا دیا گیا اور لوگوں کے دلوں کو خدا سے جوڑ دیا گیا اور یہ بتادیا گیا کہ اللہ کن کن باتوں پر راضی ہوتا ہے۔</p><p>یہ پہلو اسلام کے اخلاقی نظام میں ایک ممتاز پہلو ہے۔ کیونکہ اسلامی اخلاقیات کسی سوسائٹی کی پیداوار نہیں ہیں ، یہ زمینی اور مادی اصولوں سے ماخوذ نہیں ہیں ، نہ یہ کسی رسم و رواج ، عزت ، مصلحت اور باہمی روابط وتعلقات سے ماخوذ ہیں۔ ان اخلاقیات کا دارومدار رضائے الٰہی پر ہے۔ اس دعوت پر ہے کہ لوگو ، اللہ کی طرف بلند ہوجاﺅ، اللہ کی صفات حمیدہ کو اپنے اندر پیدا کرو ، تاکہ تمہاری انسانیت کے آفاق آسمانوں سے مل جائیں ، تاکہ تم اخروی زندگی کو بہتر کرنے کی صلاحیت اپنے اندر پاﺅ۔ اور تم اللہ کے ہاں۔</p><p>فی مقعد .................... مقتدر (45 : 55) ” ایک مقتدر بادشاہ کے ہاں سچی مجلس میں “ بیٹھنے کے قابل ہوجاﺅ۔ اس لئے اسلامی اخلاقیات کسی مادی تصور کے اندر محدود نہیں ہیں۔ یہ لامحدود اخلاقیات ہیں۔ اور یہ ان انتہائی بلندیوں پر ہیں جہاں تک کوئی انسان پہنچنے کا تصور نہیں کرسکتا ہے۔ کیونکہ یہ اخلاقیات اللہ کی صفات کی پیروی پر مبنی ہیں ، گرے ہوئے مادی اصولوں سے ماخوذ نہیں ہیں۔</p><p>پھر اسلامی اخلاقیات ، مفرد اخلاقیات نہیں ہیں۔ صدق ، امانت ، عدل ، رحم ، نیکی ، یہ سب ایسی اخلاقیات ہیں ، جن میں ایک سے زیادہ انسانوں کا بہم تعلق پیش نظر ہوتا ہے۔ یہ ایک نظام کے ساتھ متعلق اخلاقیات ہیں۔ باہم تعاون ، باہم معاملہ ، تقسیم کار اور تقسیم حقوق اور اجتماعی تنظیم سے متعلق امور ہیں۔ ان کا تعلق زندگی کے ایک تصور سے ہے اور ان کا ماخذ ذات باری ہے۔ اس لئے یہ ربیانیت یا ذاتی اذن پر مبنی بھی نہیں ہیں اور مادی مفادات اور زمین کے اعتبارات ان کا ماخذ نہیں ہے بلکہ اللہ کی رضا ان کا اصل ماخذ ہے۔</p><p>یہ اخلاقیات اپنے کمال ، جمال ، توازن ، سیدھے پن ، تسلسل اور ثبات کے پہلو سے حضرت محمد ﷺ میں مکمل طور پر منفکس ہوئیں اور اس وجہ سے حضور ﷺ سے کہا گیا۔</p><p>وانک ................ عظیم (86 : 4) ” اور بیشک تم اخلاق کے بڑے مرتبے پر ہو “۔ اس تعریف عظیم کے بعد فرمایا جاتا ہے کہ آپ کا مستقبل نہایت تابناک ہے۔ مشرکین سے کہہ دیں کہ تم اپنے برے انجام کا انتظار کرو ، تم خلق عظیم کے مالک پر ایسے الزامات عائد کرتے ہو تنبیہ کی جاتی ہے کہ تمہارے دعوﺅں کی حقیقت تم پر جلد ہی کھل جائے گی کہ مجنون کون ہے ؟</p>"

In this verse, the demented people are invited to think carefully about the lofty morals of the Holy Prophet ﷺ .</p><p>The Holy Prophet's Exalted Quality of Character</p><p>Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ has said that 'exalted quality of character' signifies a 'great religion, and it is Islam, a religion dearest to Allah'. Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ was asked about the Holy Prophet's ﷺ character. She replied: \"The Holy Prophet's \tﷺ character was the Qur'an itself'. In other words, he is the living example of the Qur'an that teaches high morals. Sayyidna ` Ali ؓ said that 'exalted quality of character' signifies the 'good manners which the Qur'an has taught'. All these interpretations have almost the same significance. That is to say, not only that the Holy Prophet ﷺ is not an insane person, but he is the sublime and noblest of men possessing in full measure all the moral excellence that combine to make their possessor a perfect image of his Creator. The Holy Prophet's ﷺ humanity was of the most perfect character. He was a complete embodiment of all good moral qualities that a man is capable of possessing. The Holy Prophet ﷺ himself said:</p><p>بعثت لاتمم مکارم الاخلاق</p><p>\"I have only been sent to perfect noble character/conduct.\" [ Abu Hayyan ].</p><p>Sayyidna Anas ؓ said:</p><p>\"I served Allah's Messenger ﷺ for ten years, and he never said a word of displeasure to me, nor did he ever say to me concerning something I had done: 'Why did you do that?' And he never said to me concerning what I had not done: 'Why did you not do this?'\" [ Bukhari and Muslim ].</p><p>Obviously, a ten-year period is a long time during which some unpleasant or objectionable thing might have happened.</p><p>Sayyidna Anas ؓ said:</p><p>\"As a result of the Holy Prophet's noble character, any slave-girl of Madinah would hold his hand and take him wherever she would like to.\"</p><p>Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ said: \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ never struck anyone with his hands except when he was fighting in jihad in the cause of Allah.\" It is confirmed that when he fought jihad in the cause of Allah, he killed unbelievers. Otherwise he did not hit any servant, nor any woman. He would never take revenge for any harm or mistake done. He would only implement Shar’ i punishment on those who violated Allah's laws. [ Transmitted by Muslim ].</p><p>Sayyidna Jabir ؓ says that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was never asked for anything for which he said 'No'. [ Bukhari and Muslim ].</p><p>Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ said:</p><p>\"Allah's Messenger ﷺ was never vulgar, never pretended to be vulgar and he never shouted in the marketplaces. He never responded to evil by evil, but always pardoned and overlooked.\"</p><p>Sayyidna Abu-d-Darda' ؓ narrates that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>\"Noble character will be the heaviest thing on a Muslim's scale of good deeds on the Day of Resurrection. Allah detests the rude and foul-mouthed person.\" [ Transmitted by Tirmidhi, grading it as a Tradition which is 'hasan'].</p><p>Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ narrates that Allah's Messenger ﷺ \"said:</p><p>\"Indeed by virtue of good character, a believer can attain the status of votaries who spend their nights in worship and their days in fasting.\" [ Abu Dawud ].</p><p>Sayyidna Mu'dh Ibn Jabal ؓ narrates that when he placed his foot into the stirrup of his mount, as he was departing for Yemen as the governor of that province, Allah's Messenger ﷺ advised him:</p><p>یا مَعَاذ اَحسِن خُلُقَکَ لِلنَّاس</p><p>\"0 Mu` adh, display your best character with people.\" [ Transmitted by Malik ].</p><p>All narratives cited here have been adopted from Tafsir Mazhari.</p>"

Когда мать правоверных Аишу спросили, каким был нрав посланника Аллаха, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, она сказала: «Его нравом был Коран». О его благородных качествах Всевышний сказал: «Прояви снисходительность, вели творить добро и отвернись от невежд» (7:199); «По милости Аллаха ты был мягок по отношению к ним» (3:159); «К вам явился Посланник из вашей среды. Тяжко для него то, что вы страдаете» (9:128). Есть еще много других откровений о благонравии Пророка Мухаммада, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, каждое из которых учит людей воспитывать в себе только самые прекрасные черты. Все они в самой совершенной и самой славной форме воплотились в Пророке Мухаммаде, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует. Каждая черта его характера была в высшей степени образцовой. Он был мягким и сострадательным человеком. Люди легко находили с ним общий язык, и он всегда охотно принимал их приглашения. Пророк никогда не отказывал в помощи нуждающимся и всеми силами пытался утешить тех, кто искал утешения. Он не позволял себе лишить человека доброй надежды и разочаровать его своим отказом. Когда его сподвижники испрашивали его позволения начать какое-либо дело, то он благословлял их и даже помогал им, если только это не было сопряжено с грехом. Когда же он принимал решение, то не проявлял самовластия, а советовался со своими сподвижниками и обсуждал с ними свои планы. Пророк, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, радушно встречал благодеяния своих сторонников и прощал им их ошибки. Общаясь с собеседником, он был приветлив и не прекращал беседы первым. Он не хмурился и не был грубым при разговоре. Если ему что-то было приятно, то он не скрывал своей радости. Он не придирался к тому, что ненароком слетало с уст его собеседника, и не попрекал его за грубость. Он изо всех сил пытался ответить ему добром и проявить должное терпение. Аллах вознес Пророка Мухаммада, да благословит его Аллах и приветствует, до недосягаемых высот, но его враги сочли его безумным и одержимым. Поэтому далее Коран гласит:"

The word maftun, in this context, means 'demented'. In the preceding verses, the Holy Prophet ', was accused of being an insane and demented. This verse turns tables upon the accusers of the Holy Prophet , and making a prophecy, tells them in challenging words that time will show whether it was he or they who suffered from insanity, or whether his claim to be Allah's Messenger ﷺ was the outpouring of heated brain, or whether they themselves were so demented as not to read the signs of time, and thus refuse to believe in him. These were the unfortunate, wretched ones who did not see the light of Truth and were thus disgraced and defeated in this world. But, on the other hand, there were thousands of other lucky ones who, at first did not see the light of Truth and denounced him as demented, soon saw the light and embraced the Faith of Islam. They took the love and obedience of the Holy Prophet  as the capital asset of success, prosperity and happiness.</p>"

ہم اس صورت حال کو برداشت نہیں کرسکتے کہ وہ ہمارے آباﺅاجداد کو گالیاں دے ، ہمارے عقائد کو احمقانہ بتلائے اور ہمارے الہوں کی عیب جوئی کرے۔ یا تو آپ اسے روکیں یا پھر اس کی حمایت سے ہاتھ اٹھالیں ورنہ ہمارے اور تمہارے درمیان جنگ ہوگی جو فریق بھی ہلاک ہوگیا۔ یا اس طرح کی سخت باتیں انہوں نے کہیں اور چلے گئے۔ ابوطالب پر قوم کے درمیان یہ جھگڑا ذرا گراں گزرا۔ اور انہوں نے پوری قوم کی عداوت کو بھاری سمجھا۔ اور یہ بھی وہ نہ چاہتے تھے کہ رسول اللہ ﷺ کو ان کے حوالے کردیں اور شرمندگی اٹھائیں۔ ابن اسحاق کہتے ہیں کہ مجھے یعقوب ابن عتبہ ابن مغیرہ ابن اخنس نے بتایا کہ جب قریش نے ابوطالب سے یہ باتیں کیں تو انہوں نے حضرت نبی ﷺ کو بلایا۔ ان سے کہا بھتیجے ! تمہاری قوم میرے پاس آئی اور انہوں نے یہ کہا اور یہ کہا۔ اس لئے تم مجھ پر اور اپنے آپ پر ذرا رحم کرو اور مجھ پر اس قدر بوجھ نہ ڈالو جس کے اٹھانے کی مجھے طاقت نہ ہو۔ رسول اللہ ﷺ نے یہ سمجھا کہ شاید ابوطالب کی رائے اس معاملے میں بدل گئی ہے۔ اور یہ کہ آپ بھی اب ساتھ چھوڑنے والے ہیں اور مجھے قریش کے حوالے کرنے والے ہیں اور یہ کہ ابو طالب بھی اب حمایت اور نصرت سے دسکش ہورہے ہیں۔ تو حضور ﷺ نے فرمایا : ” چچا ! خدا کی قسم اگر یہ لوگ میرے دائیں ہاتھ پر سورج اور بائیں ہاتھ پر چاند بھی لاکر رکھ دیں اور یہ مطالبہ کریں کہ یہ کام چھوڑ دو تو یہ نہیں ہوسکتا ، میں یہ کام کرتارہوں گا جب تک یہ دین غالب نہیں ہوجاتا یا میں ہلاک نہیں ہوجاتا۔ کہتے ہیں کہ رسول اللہ ﷺ کی آواز روندھ گئی اور آپ روپڑے اور اٹھ کر چلے گئے۔ جب آپ چلے گئے تو ابو طالب نے آواز دی : بھتیجے ! ادھر آﺅ، رسول اللہ ﷺ واپس ہوئے تو انہوں نے کہا ” جاﺅ جو چاہو کرو ، خدا کی قسم میں تمہیں کسی قیمت پر ان کے حوالے نہ کروں گا “۔</p><p>یہ ہے تصویر حضور اکرم ﷺ کی کہ آپ اس وقت بھی اپنی دعوت پر جمے ہوئے تھے جبکہ آپ کے چچا محترم بھی دستکش ہونے کے بارے میں سوچ رہے تھے۔ جو آپ کے حامی اور محافظ تھے اور یہ آخری قلعہ تھے ، جس میں آپ اس کرہارض پر اپنے دشمنوں کے مقابلے میں پناہ لے سکتے تھے۔</p><p>یہ تو تھی ایک نہایت ہی روشن اور قوی تصویر۔ یہ اپنی نوعیت اور حقیقت کے اعتبار سے بالکل ایک انوکھی تصویر تھی۔ اس کا رنگ اور پر تو سب ہی انوکھے تھے۔ اس کی عبارت اور مکالمات بھی اپنی نوعیت کے تھے۔ نہایت نئے اور سنجیدہ موقف کی ایک تصویر اس طرح روشن ، جس طرح یہ عقیدہ روشن ہے۔ اور اس میں سرٹیفکیٹ اور شہادت کا مصادق اور مفہوم موجود۔</p><p>وانک .................... عظیم (86 : 4) ” اور بیشک آپ عظیم اخلاق کے نہایت ہی بلند مرتبے پر ہیں “۔ اور ان اخلاق عالیہ کی ایک دوسری تصویر بھی خود ابن اسحاق نے نقل کی ہے۔ کہتے ہیں روایت بیان کی یزید ابن اسحاق نے ، محمد ابن کعب قرظی سے ، انہوں نے کہا مجھے یہ بتایا گیا کہ عتبہ ابن ربیعہ ایک سردار تھا۔ یہ ایک دن قریش کی ایک محفل میں بیٹھا ہوا تھا ، اس نے تجویز پیش کی ، جبکہ حضور اکرم ﷺ مسجد حرام میں اکیلے بیٹھے ہوئے تھے ، کیا مناسب نہیں ہے کہ میں محمد ﷺ سے بات کروں اور ان کے سامنے کچھ باتیں رکھوں شاید وہ اسے قبول کرلیں۔ اس طرح کہ ان کے جو مطالبات ہوں ہم انہیں دے دیں اور وہ ہمارے خداﺅں سے باز آجائیں۔ یہ اس وقت کی بات ہے جب حضرت حمزہ اسلام قبول کرچکے تھے اور قریش نے دیکھ لیا تھا کہ حضور ﷺ کے حامیوں میں اضافہ ہورہا ہے۔ انہوں نے کہا : ابو الولید جاﺅ اور ان سے بات کرو ، عتبہ اٹھا اور آیا اور رسول اللہ ﷺ کے سامنے بیٹھ گیا۔ اس نے کہا بھتیجے ! ہمارے اندر تمہاری جو حیثیت ہے ، وہ تم جانتے ہو۔ تمہارا بہت اونچا درجہ ہے اور تمہارا نسب بھی بہت اونچا ہے اور تم نے اپنی قوم کو ایک بڑی مصیبت میں ڈال دیا ہے۔ جماعت کے اندر تفریق پیدا ہوگئی ہے۔ تم نے ہمارے نظریات کا مذاق اڑایا ہے ، ہمارے دین اور الہوں پر تنقید کی ہے اور تم نے ہمارے آباﺅ اجداد کو کافر کہا۔ تم میری بات سنو ۔ میں تمہارے سامنے کچھ تجاویز پیش کرتا ہوں۔ امید ہے کہ تم ان پر غور کرو گے۔ شاید ان میں سے بعض کو تم منظور کرلو۔ کہتے ہیں کہ رسول اللہ ﷺ نے فرمایا : ” ابوالولید کہو۔ میں سنتا ہوں “ اس نے کہا : ” بھتیجے ! تم جو دین پیش کرتے ہو اگر اس سے تمہارا مقصد بہت زیادہ مال جمع کرنا ہے ، تو ہم تمہارے لئے اس قدر مال جمع کرتے ہیں کہ تم ہم میں سب سے زیادہ مالدار ہوجاﺅ گے۔ اور اگر تم اونچا مقام چاہتے ہو تو ہم تم کو اپنا سردار بناتے ہیں ، ہم تمہارے بغیر کوئی فیصلہ نہ کریں گے۔ اگر تم بادشاہت چاہتے ہو تو ہم تم کو اپنا بادشاہ تسلیم کرتے ہیں۔ اور اگر تم پر کوئی دورہ پڑتا ہے جس کا دفعیہ تم نہیں کرسکتے تو ہم تمہارے علاج کا انتظام کرتے ہیں۔ اس پر ہم سے جو ہوسکا ، خرچ کریں گے یہاں تک کہ تم تندرست ہوجاﺅ۔ بعض اوقات یوں ہوتا ہے کہ انسان کے ساتھ کوئی چیز لگ جاتی ہے اور اس کو اس کا علاج کرنا پڑتا ہے “۔ یہ اور ایسی اور باتیں جو اس نے کیں۔ عتبہ ان باتوں سے فارغ ہوا اور رسول اللہ یہ باتیں سنتے رہے۔ اس کے بعد حضور ﷺ نے فرمایا : ابو الولید تم کہہ چکے ؟ اس نے کہا : ” ہاں “۔ اس پر حضور ﷺ نے فرمایا اب میری بات سنو۔ اس نے کہا : ہاں ” کہو “۔ اس پر حضور ﷺ نے پڑھنا شروع کیا :</p><p>حٰم ................................ ویل للمشرکین (6) (14 : 1 تا 6) ” ح م۔ یہ خدائے رحمن ورحیم کی طرف سے نازل کردہ چیز ہے ، ایک ایسی کتاب جس کی آیات خوب کھول کر بیان کی گئی ہیں۔ عربی زبان کا قرآن ، ان لوگوں کے لئے جو علم رکھتے ہیں ، بشارت دینے والا اور ڈرانے والا مگر ان لوگوں میں سے اکثر نے اس سے روگردانی کی اور وہ سن کر نہیں دیتے۔ کہتے ہیں ” جس چیز کی طرف تو ہمیں بلارہا ہے اس کے لئے ہمارے دلوں پر غلاف چڑھے ہوئے ہیں ، ہمارے کان بہرے ہوگئے ہیں اور ہمارے اور تیرے درمیان ایک حجاب حائل ہوگیا ہے تو اپنا کام کر ہم اپنا کام کیے جائیں گے “۔ اے نبی ان سے کہو ، میں تو ایک بشر ہوں تم جیسا۔ مجھے وحی کے ذریعہ بتایا جاتا ہے کہ تمہارا خدا بس ایک ہی خدا ہے ، لہٰذا تم سیدھے اسی کا رخ اختیار کرو۔ اور اس سے معافی چاہو۔ تباہی ہے مشرکوں کے لئے ....“</p><p>حضور ﷺ اس کے بعد بھی سورة حم سجدہ پڑھتے رہے۔ جب عتبہ نے اسے سنا تو خاموش ہوگیا اور اپنے ہاتھ پشت کے پیچھے زمین پر لگا کر ٹیک لی اور سنتا رہا۔ اب رسول اللہ ﷺ سجدہ تک پہنچ گئے اور آپ نے سجدہ کیا۔ اس کے بعد حضور ﷺ نے فرمایا ابو الولید تم نے سنا جو سنا بس یہ ہے جواب تم جانو اور تمہارا کام “۔ عتبہ اپنے ساتھیوں کے پاس گیا ۔ انہوں نے ایک دوسرے سے کہا : ” ہم خدا کی قسم اٹھا کر کہتے ہیں کہ یہ شخص جو چہرہ لے کر گیا تھا اس کے ساتھ واپس نہیں آیا۔ جب یہ جاکر ان کی محفل میں بیٹھا تو انہوں نے پوچھا ابوالولید کیا خبر لائے ہو ؟ تو اس نے کہا خبر یہ ہے کہ میں نے ایک ایسا کلام سنا ہے خدا کی قسم میں نے ایسا کوئی کلام کبھی نہیں سنا۔ یہ نہ تو شعر ہے نہ جادو ہے ، نہ کہانت ہے۔ اے اہل قریش میری بات مانوں اور میں اس کا ذمہ دار ہوں ، یہ شخص جو کچھ کرنا چاہتا ہے اسے کرنے دو اور اس کی راہ نہ روکو۔ اس کو الگ چھوڑ دو ، خدا کی قسم اس کی جو بات میں نے سنی ہے اس کی شہ سرخی لگنے والی ہے۔ اگر اس کو عربوں نے ختم کردیا تو تمہارا کام وہ کردیں گے اور تمہیں اسے مارنے کی ضرورت نہ ہوگی اور اگر یہ عربوں پر غالب آگیا تو اس کی حکومت تمہاری حکومت ہوگی اور اس کی عزت تمہاری عزت ہوگی۔ اور تم اس کی وجہ سے نہایت ہی نیک بخت ہوگئے ، انہوں نے کہا ابوالولید خدا کی قسم اس نے اپنی زبان سے تمہیں مسحور کردیا۔ اس نے کہا : اس کے بارے میں یہ میری حقیقی رائے ہے۔ اب تمہاری مرضی ہے جو چاہو کرتے رہو۔</p><p>دوسری روایات میں آتا ہے کہ حضور اکرم ﷺ کو کلام الٰہی سناتے ہوئے جب اس آیت پر پہنچے۔</p><p>فان ........................ وثمود (14 : 31) ” اگر یہ لوگ منہ موڑتے ہیں تو ان سے کہہ دو کہ میں تم کو اس طرح کے ایک اچانک ٹوٹ پڑنے والے عذاب سے ڈراتا ہوں جیسا کہ عاد وثمود پر نازل ہوا تھا “ تو ابوالولید خوفزدہ ہکر اٹھا اور آپ کے منہ پر ہاتھ رکھ دیا اور کہنے لگا : ” محمد (ﷺ ) میں تمہیں خدا کا اور رحم کا واسطہ دیتا ہوں “۔ یہ اس ڈر کی وجہ سے کہ کہیں فی الواقع یہ عذاب نازل نہ ہوجائے۔ اس کے بعد وہ قوم کے پاس گیا اور ان سے وہ بات کہی جس کا اوپرتذکرہ ہوا۔</p><p>بہرحال یہ قریش کی طرف سے سودے بازی کی دوسری کوشش تھی۔ یہ بھی حضور اکرم ﷺ کی خلق عظیم کی ایک تصویر ہے۔ اس سے آپ کے آداب اچھی طرح معلوم ہوتے ہیں کہ آپ عتبہ کی بات نہایت تحمل سے سنتے ہیں۔ یہاں تک کہ وہ فارغ ہوجاتا ہے حالانکہ اس کی باتیں نہایت بےمعنی ہیں۔ ان باتوں کا تعلق صرف اس زمین سے ہے۔ لیکن آپ کے اخلاق کریمانہ تھے کہ آپ نہ اس کی بات کاٹتے ہیں نہ جلدی کرتے ہیں اور نہ غصے میں آتے ہیں اور اس کو جھڑکتے ہیں۔ یہاں تک کہ یہ شخص اپنی بیہودہ باتوں سے فارغ ہوجاتا ہے اور آپ پوری توجہ سے سنتے ہیں۔ اس کے بعد آپ نہایت نرمی سے پوچھتے ہیں۔ ابوالولید آپ کی بات ختم ہوئی ، اور یہ تاکید مزید کے لئے کہ وہ یہ نہ کہے کہ میری بات رہتی ہے۔ یہ ہے سچا اطمینان ، اور حقیقی ادب کہ آپ پوری پوری بات سنتے ہیں۔ یہ بھی آپ کے خلق عظیم کا ایک پہلو ہے۔ بیہودہ باتیں بھی تحمل سے سنتے ہیں۔</p><p>اور ایک تیسری سودا بازی بھی مروی ہے۔ ابن اسحاق روایت کرتے ہیں کہ رسول اللہ ﷺ خانہ کعبہ کا طواف کررہے تھے کہ اسود ابن المطلب ابن اسد ابن عبدالعزی ، ولید ابن مغیرہ ، امیہ ابن خلف اور عاص ابن وائل سہمی نے آپ کو روکا اور یہ لوگ اپنے قبائل میں نہایت معتبر لوگ تھے۔ انہوں نے کہا : ” محمد ﷺ ہم اس کی عبادت کرتے ہیں جس کو تم کرتے ہو ، اور تم ان الہوں کی عبادت کرو جن کی ہم کرتے ہیں۔ ہم اور تم شریک ہوجائیں گے۔ اگر جس خدا کی تم عبادت کرتے ہو وہ اچھا ہوا تو ہمارا بھی اس میں حصہ ہوگا اور ہم جن کی عبادت کرتے ہیں اگر وہ اچھے ہوئے تو تم نے بھی اپنا حصہ اس بھلائی سے لیا ہوگا۔ ان کے بارے میں اللہ نے یہ سورت نازل کی۔</p><p>قل یایھا الکفرون ................ تعبدون (901 : 2) ” اے کافرو !

This is because the liar, due to his weakness and his disgracefulness, only seeks protection in his false oaths which he boldly swears to while using Allah's Names, and he uses them (false oaths) all the time and out of place (i.e., unnecessarily). Ibn `Abbas said, \"Al-Mahin means the liar.\" Then Allah says,</p><p>هَمَّازٍ</p><p>(A Hammaz, ) Ibn `Abbas and Qatadah both said, \"This is slander.\"</p><p>مَّشَّآءِ بِنَمِيمٍ</p><p>(going about with Namim,) This refers to the one who goes around among people instigating discord between them and carrying tales in order to corrupt relations between people when they are good and pleasant. It is confirmed in the Two Sahihs that Mujahid reported from Tawus that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ once passed by two graves and he said,</p><p>«إِنَّهُمَا لَيُعَذَّبَانِ وَمَا يُعَذَّبَانِ فِي كَبِيرٍ، أَمَّا أَحَدُهُمَا فَكَانَ لَا يَسْتَتِرُ مِنَ الْبَوْلِ، وَأَمَّا الْاخَرُ فَكَانَ يَمْشِي بِالنَّمِيمَة»</p><p>(Verily, these two are being punished, and they are not being punished for something major. One of them was not careful about protecting himself from urine (when relieving himself). The other one used to spread Namimah.)\" This Hadith has been recorded by the Group in their books through routes of transmission that are all on the authority of Mujahid. Imam Ahmad recorded that Hudhayfah said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p>«لَا يَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ قَتَّات»</p><p>(The slanderer will not enter into Paradise.)\" This Hadith has been reported by the Group except for Ibn Majah. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>مَّنَّاعٍ لِّلْخَيْرِ مُعْتَدٍ أَثِيمٍ</p><p>(Hinderer of good, transgressor, sinful,) it means, he refuses to give and withholds that which he has of good.</p><p>مُعْتَدٍ</p><p>(transgressor,) this means, in attaining that which Allah has made permissible for him, he exceeds the legislated bounds.</p><p>أَثِيمٍ</p><p>(sinful,) meaning, he delves into the forbidden things. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>عُتُلٍّ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ زَنِيمٍ</p><p>(`Utul, and moreover Zanim.) `Utul means one who is cruel, harsh, strong, greedy and stingy. Imam Ahmad recorded from Al-Harithah bin Wahb that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَلَا أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِأَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ؟ كُلُّ ضَعِيفٍ مُتَضَعِّفٍ لَوْ أَقْسَمَ عَلَى اللهِ لَأَبَرَّهُ. أَلَا أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِأَهْلِ النَّارِ؟ كُلُّ عُتُلَ جَوَّاظٍ مُسْتَكْبِر»</p><p>(Shall I inform you of the people of Paradise (They will be) every weak and oppressed person. When he swears by Allah, he fulfills his oath. Shall I inform you of the people of the Fire Every `Utul (cruel person), Jawwaz and arrogant person.) Al-Waki` said, \"It (`Utul) is every Jawwaz, Ja`zari and arrogant person.\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this in their Two Sahihs, as well as the rest of the Group, except for Abu Dawud. All of its routes of transmission are by way of Sufyan Ath-Thawri and Shu`bah who both reported it from Sa`id bin Khalid. The scholars of Arabic language have said that Ja`zari means rude and harsh, while Jawwaz means greedy and stingy. Concerning the word Zanim, Al-Bukhari recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning the Ayah,</p><p>عُتُلٍّ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ زَنِيمٍ</p><p>(`Utul (cruel), and moreover Zanim.) \"A man from the Quraysh who stands out among them like the sheep that has had a piece of its ear cut off.\" The meaning of this is that he is famous for his evil just as a sheep that has a piece of its ear cut off stands out among its sister sheep. In the Arabic language the Zanim is a person who is adopted among a group of people (i.e., he is not truly of them). Ibn Jarir and others among the Imams have said this. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>أَن كَانَ ذَا مَالٍ وَبَنِينَ - إِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِ ءَايَـتُنَا قَالَ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>((He was so) because he had wealth and children. When Our Ayat are recited to him, he says: \"Tales of the men of old!\") Allah is saying, `this is how he responds to the favors that Allah has bestowed upon him of wealth and children, by disbelieving in Allah's Ayat and turning away from them while claiming that they are a lie that has been taken from the tales of the ancients.' This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>ذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً - وَجَعَلْتُ لَهُ مَالاً مَّمْدُوداً - وَبَنِينَ شُهُوداً - وَمَهَّدتُّ لَهُ تَمْهِيداً - ثُمَّ يَطْمَعُ أَنْ أَزِيدَ - كَلاَّ إِنَّهُ كان لاٌّيَـتِنَا عَنِيداً - سَأُرْهِقُهُ صَعُوداً - إِنَّهُ فَكَّرَ وَقَدَّرَ - فَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ - ثُمَّ قُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ - ثُمَّ نَظَرَ - ثُمَّ عَبَسَ وَبَسَرَ - ثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ وَاسْتَكْبَرَ - فَقَالَ إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ يُؤْثَرُ - إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ قَوْلُ الْبَشَرِ - سَأُصْلِيهِ سَقَرَ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا سَقَرُ - لاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ - لَوَّاحَةٌ لِّلْبَشَرِ - عَلَيْهَا تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ</p><p>(Leave Me alone (to deal) with whom I created lonely (without any wealth and children etc.). And then granted him resources in abundance. And children to be by his side. And made life smooth and comfortable for him. After all that he desires that I should give more. Nay! Verily, he has been opposing Our Ayat. I shall oblige him to face a severe torment! Verily, he thought and plotted. So let him be cursed, how he plotted! And once more let him be cursed, how he plotted! Then he thought. Then he frowned and he looked in a bad tempered way. Then he turned back, and was proud. Then he said: \"This is nothing but magic from that of old, this is nothing but the word of a human being!\" I will cast him into Hellfire.

Он отверг ее тогда, когда она сама открылась ему, и счел ее древними преданиями, в которые можно и верить, и не верить.\nНесмотря на это, обсуждаемые нами аяты в полной мере относятся ко всем, кто обладает подобными порочными качествами, потому что Коран ниспослан как истинное руководство для всех людей — как для тех, кто жил в первые годы его ниспослания, так и для их потомков.\nНекоторые коранические аяты ниспосылались по поводу того или иного че- ловека, но заключали в себе всеобщий смысл. Благодаря этому правоверные и по сей день на примере отдельных личностей познают судьбу всех им подобных.                </div><div lang=\"ru\" class=\"ru \">\n<span class=\"green\">(16)</span> Всевышний ниспослал грозное предостережение своему врагу, который обладает вы- шеперечисленными качествами.

Этому наказанию надле- жало отразиться клеймом на его лице, дабы его страдания были еще более тяжкими.                </div>"

তারা হলো চুগলখোর, যারা বন্ধুদের মধ্যে বিবাদ বাধিয়ে থাকে এবং সৎ ও পবিত্র লোকদের উপর মিথ্যা অপবাদ দিয়ে থাকে।” (ইমাম ইবন মাজাহও (রঃ) এ হাদীসটি বর্ণনা করেছেন)এরপর আল্লাহ তা'আলা ঐ সব লোকের আরো বদ অভ্যাসের বর্ণনা দিচ্ছেন যে, তারা কল্যাণের কার্যে বাধা দান করে, তারা সীমালংঘনকারী ও পাপিষ্ঠ। অর্থাৎ তারা নিজেরা ভাল কাজ করা হতে বিরত থাকে এবং অন্যদেরকেও বিরত রাখে, হালাল জিনিস ও হালাল কাজ হতে সরে গিয়ে হারাম ভক্ষণে ও হারাম কার্যে লিপ্ত হয়ে পড়ে। তারা পাপী, দুষ্কর্মপরায়ণ ও হারাম ভক্ষণকারী। তারা দুশ্চরিত্র, রূঢ় স্বভাব এবং তদুপরি কুখ্যাত। তারা শুধু সম্পদ জমা করে এবং কাউকেও কিছুই দেয় না। মুসনাদে আহমাদে হযরত হারিসাহ ইবনে অহাব (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “আমি কি তোমাদেরকে জান্নাতী লোকের পরিচয় দিবো না? প্রত্যেক দুর্বল ব্যক্তি, যাকে দুর্বল মনে করা হয় (সেই জান্নাতী)। যদি সে আল্লাহর নামে কোন শপথ করে তবে আল্লাহ তা বাস্তবায়িত করে দেন। আর আমি কি তোমাদেরকে জাহান্নামীর সংবাদ দিবো না? প্রত্যেক অত্যাচারী, যালিম ও অহংকারী (জাহান্নামী)।” (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম বুখারী (রঃ) ও ইমাম মুসলিম (রঃ) তাখরীজ করেছেন) অন্য এক হাদীসে আছেঃ “প্রত্যেক জমাকারী ও বাধাদানকারী, অশ্লীলভাষী এবং রূঢ় স্বভাব ব্যক্তি (জাহান্নামী)।আর একটি বর্ণনায় আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) কে জিজ্ঞেস করা হয়ঃ (আরবি) কে? উত্তরে তিনি বলেনঃ “দুশ্চরিত্র, রূঢ় স্বভাব, অত্যধিক পানাহারকারী, লোকদের উপর অত্যাচারকারী এবং বড় পেটুক ব্যক্তি।” (এ হাদীসটি বহু সংখ্যক বর্ণনাকারী মুরসাল রূপে বর্ণনা করেছেন)হযরত যায়েদ ইবনে আসলাম (রঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “ঐ ব্যক্তির ব্যাপারে আকাশ কাঁদে যাকে আল্লাহ তা'আলা শারীরিক সুস্থতা দান করেছেন, পেট পুরে খেতে দিয়েছেন এবং জায়গা-জমি, ধন-সম্পদ (অর্থাৎ দুনিয়ার ভোগ্যবস্তু সবকিছুই) দান করেছেন এতদসত্ত্বেও সে জনগণের উপর অত্যাচার করে থাকে।” (এ হাদীসটিও দুই মুরসাল পন্থায় বর্ণিত হয়েছে)মোটকথা (আরবি) ঐ ব্যক্তিকে বলা হয় যার দেহ সুস্থ ও সবল, বেশী পানাহারকারী এবং খুবই শক্তিশালী। আর (আরবি) হলো ঐ ব্যক্তি যে বদনামী কুখ্যাত। আরবদের পরিভাষায় (আরবি) ঐ লোককে বলা হয় যাকে কোন এক সম্প্রদায়ভুক্ত মনে করা হয়, আসলে কিন্তু সে ঐ সম্প্রদায়ভুক্ত নয়। আরব কবিরাও এটাকে এই অর্থেই ব্যবহার করেছেন, অর্থাৎ যার নসবনামা সঠিক নয়। কথিত আছে যে, এর দ্বারা আখনাস ইবনে শুরায়েক সাকাফীকে বুঝানো হয়েছে, যে বানু যারা গোত্রের মিত্র ছিল। আবার কেউ কেউ বলেন যে, আসওয়াদ ইবনে আবদি ইয়াগুস যুহরীদের বুঝানো হয়েছে। ইকরামা (রঃ) বলেন যে, জারজ সন্তান উদ্দেশ্য। এটাও বর্ণিত আছে যে, কর্তিত কান বিশিষ্ট বকরী, যে কান তার গলদেশে ঝুলতে থাকে, এরূপ বকরীকে যেমন পালের মধ্যে সহজেই চেনা যায় ঠিক তেমনই মুমিনকে কাফির হতে সহজেই পৃথক করা যায়। এ ধরনের আরো বহু উক্তি রয়েছে। কিন্তু সবগুলোরই সারমর্ম হলো এই যে, (আরবি) হলো ঐ ব্যক্তি যে কুখ্যাত এবং যার সঠিক নসবনামা এবং প্রকৃত পিতার পরিচয় জানা যায় না। এ ধরনের লোকদের উপর শয়তান খুব বেশী জয়যুক্ত হয় এবং তাদের উপর প্রভাব বিস্তার করে থাকে। যেমন হাদীসে এসেছেঃ “জারজ সন্তান জান্নাতে প্রবেশ করবে না। অন্য এক হাদীসে আছেঃ জারজ সন্তান তিনজন মন্দ লোকের একজন, যদি সেও তার পিতা-মাতার মত আমল করে।”এরপর মহাপ্রতাপান্বিত আল্লাহ বলেনঃ তাদের দুষ্কর্মের কারণ এই যে, তারা ধন-সম্পদ ও সন্তান-সন্ততিতে সমৃদ্ধশালী। আমার নিয়ামতসমূহের শুকরিয়া আদায় তো দূরের কথা, তারা আমার আয়াতসমূহকে মিথ্যা প্রতিপন্ন করে এবং ঘৃণার স্বরে বলেঃ এটা তো সেকালের উপকথা মাত্র। যেমন অন্য জায়গায় আল্লাহ তাবারাকা ওয়া তা'আলা বলেনঃ (আরবি)অর্থাৎ “আমাকে ছেড়ে দাও এবং তাকে যাকে আমি সৃষ্টি করেছি অসাধারণ করে। আমি তাকে দিয়েছি বিপুল ধন-সম্পদ এবং নিত্যসঙ্গী পুত্রগণ। আর তাকে দিয়েছি স্বাচ্ছন্দ জীবনের প্রচুর উপকরণ। এরপরও সে কামনা করে যে, আমি তাকে আরও অধিক দিই। না, তা হবে না, সে তো আমার নিদর্শনসমূহের উদ্ধত বিরুদ্ধাচারী। আমি অচিরেই তাকে ক্রমবর্ধমান শাস্তি দ্বারা আচ্ছন্ন করবো! সে তো চিন্তা করলো এবং সিদ্ধান্ত গ্রহণ করলো! অভিশপ্ত হোক সে! কেমন করে সে এই সিদ্ধান্ত করলো! আরও অভিশপ্ত হোক সে! কেমন করে সে এই সিদ্ধান্তে উপনীত হলো! সে আবার চেয়ে দেখলো। অতঃপর সে কুঞ্চিত করলো ও মুখ বিকৃত করলো। অতঃপর সে পিছনে ফিরলো এবং দম্ভ প্রকাশ করলো, এবং ঘোষণা করলোঃ এটাতো লোক পরম্পরায় প্রাপ্ত যাদু ছাড়া আর কিছু নয়, এটা তো মানুষেরই কথা। আমি তাকে নিক্ষেপ করবো সাকারে। তুমি কি জান সাকার কি? ওটা তাদেরকে জীবিতাবস্থায় রাখবে না ও মৃত অবস্থায় ছেড়ে দিবে না। এটা তো গাত্র চর্ম দগ্ধ করবে! সাকার-এর তত্ত্বাবধানে রয়েছে উনিশ জন প্রহরী।” (৭৪:১১-৩০)আল্লাহ তা’আলা এরপর বলেনঃ আমি তার নাক দাগিয়ে দিবো। অর্থাৎ আমি তাকে এমনভাবে লাঞ্ছিত করবো যে, তার লাঞ্ছনা কারো কাছে গোপন থাকবে না। সবাই তার পরিচয় জেনে নিবে। যেমন দাগযুক্ত নাক বিশিষ্ট লোককে এক নযর দেখলেই হাজার হাজার লোকের মধ্যেও চিনতে অসুবিধা হয় না এবং সে তার নাকের দাগ গোপন করতে চাইলেও গোপন করতে পারে না, অনুরূপভাবে ঐ লাঞ্ছিত ও অপমানিত ব্যক্তির লাঞ্ছনা ও অপমান কারো অজানা থাকবে না। এটাও কথিত আছে যে, বদরের দিন তার নাকে তরবারীর আঘাত লাগবে। এটাও বলা হয়েছে যে, কিয়ামতের দিন নাকে জাহান্নামের মোহর লেগে যাবে, অর্থাৎ মুখ বন্ধ করে দেয়া হবে। তাহলে নাক দ্বারা মুখমণ্ডল উদ্দেশ্য হবে। ইমাম আবূ জা’ফর ইবনে জারীর (রঃ) এই সমুদয় উক্তি বর্ণনা করে বলেনঃ এই উক্তিগুলোর মধ্যে সামঞ্জস্য বিধান এই ভাবে হতে পারে যে, এসবই ঐ ব্যক্তির মধ্যে একত্রিত হবে। এটাও হবে এবং ওটাও হবে। দুনিয়াতেও সে অপমানিত হবে, সত্য সত্যই তার নাকে দাগ দেয়া হবে এবং কিয়ামতের দিনেও সে দাগযুক্ত অপরাধী হবে। প্রকৃতপক্ষে এটাই সঠিকতমও বটে।মুসনাদে ইবনে আবি হাতিমে হযরত আবদুল্লাহ ইবনে আমর (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “বহু বছর ধরে বান্দা আল্লাহর নিকট মুমিন রূপে লিখিত হয়, কিন্তু সে এমন অবস্থায় মৃত্যু বরণ করে যে, আল্লাহ তার প্রতি অসন্তুষ্ট থাকেন। পক্ষান্তরে বান্দা আল্লাহর নিকট বহু বছর ধরে কাফির রূপে লিখিত হয়, কিন্তু সে এমন অবস্থায় মৃত্যু বরণ করে যে, আল্লাহ তার প্রতি সন্তুষ্ট থাকেন। যে ব্যক্তি মানুষের দোষারোপকারী এবং চুগলখোর অবস্থায় মারা যাবে, কিয়ামতের দিন তার নাকের উপর তার দুই ওষ্ঠের দিক হতে দাগ দিয়ে দেয়া হবে, যা পাপীর নিদর্শনরূপে গণ্য হবে।\"</p>"

اور ان سب عیوب کے ساتھ بداصل ہے ، اس بنا پر کہ وہ بہت مال اور اولاد رکھتا ہے۔ جب ہماری آیات اس کو سنائی جاتی ہیں تو کہتا ہے یہ تو اگلے وقتوں کے افسانے ہیں۔ عنقریب ہم اس کی سونڈ پر داغ لگائیں گے “۔</p><p>بعض روایات میں آتا ہے کہ یہ ولید ابن مغیرہ ہے ، اور اسی کے بارے میں سورة مدثر کی یہ آیات بھی نازل ہوئیں :</p><p>ذرنی ................................ ساصلیہ سقر (62) (47 : 11 تا 62) ” چھوڑ دو مجھے اور اس شخص کو جسے میں نے اکیلا پیدا کیا ، بہت سا مال اس کو دیا ، اس کے ساتھ حاضر رہنے والے بیٹے اس کو دیئے ، اور اس کے لئے ریاست کی راہ ہموار کی ، پھر وہ طمع رکھتا ہے کہ میں اسے اور زیادہ دوں۔ ہرگز نہیں ، وہ ہماری آیات سے عناد رکھتا ہے۔ میں تو اسے عنقریب ایک کٹھن چڑھائی چڑھواﺅں گا۔ اس نے سوچا اور کچھ بات بنانے کی کوشش کی تو خدا کی مار اس پر ، کیسی بات بنانے کی کوشش کی ۔ ہاں ، خدا کی مار اس

کالم ہے۔ عنقریب میں اسے دوزخ میں جھونک دوں گا “۔</p><p>اس شخص کے بارے میں بہت سی روایات میں آتا ہے کہ یہ رسول اللہ ﷺ کے خلاف ہر وقت سازشوں میں لگا رہتا تھا۔ آپ کے ساتھیوں کو ڈراتا تھا۔ دعوت اسلامی کی راہ روکتا تھا۔ اور رات دن لوگوں کو اللہ کی راہ سے روکتا تھا۔ نیز بعض روایات میں یہ بھی آتا ہے کہ سورة القلم کی آیات انفنس ابن شریق اور ولید بن مغیرہ کے بارے میں ہیں۔ یہ دونوں رسول اللہ ﷺ کے سخت مخالف تھے۔ یہ ہر وقت آپ سے برسرپیکار رہتے تھے۔ اور لوگوں کو آپ کے خلاف اکساتے تھے۔</p><p>یہ سخت تہدیدی جملہ اس سورت میں اور دوسری سورتوں میں جو اس دور میں نازل ہوئیں ، اس بات کا ثبوت ہے کہ اس دور میں حالات بہت شدید تھے اور یہ شخص جو مسلمانوں اور تحریک اسلامی کے خلاف سرگرم تھا ، خواہ ولید تھا یا انس تھا (پہلا قول راجح ہے) تحریک اسلامی کی راہ روکنے میں اس کا بہت بڑا دخل تھا۔ نیز ان تنقیدی آیات سے معلوم ہوتا ہے کہ یہ شخص بہت بدفطرت شخص تھا اور اس کے نفس میں بھلائی کی کوئی رمق نہ تھی۔</p><p>یہ کس قسم کا آدمی تھا ، قرآن نے اس کی 9 صفات بیان کی ہیں اور سب کی سب مذموم صفات ہیں :</p><p>1۔ حلاف (86 : 01) (بہت قسمیں کھانے والا) زیادہ قسمیں وہی اٹھاتا ہے جو سچا نہیں ہوتا ، اس کے شعور میں یہ بات ہوتی ہے کہ لوگ اس پر اعتماد نہیں کرتے اور اسے جھوٹا سمجھتے ہیں۔ یہ شخص قسمیں اٹھاتا ہے اور بہت زیادہ قسمیں اٹھا کر اپنے جھوٹ کو چھپاتا ہے اور اس طرح لوگوں کا اعتماد حاصل کرتا ہے۔</p><p>2۔ مھین (86 : 01) (بےوقعت) اپنی نظروں میں خود ہلکا ، لوگوں کی نظروں میں ناقابل اعتبار۔ زیادہ قسمیں اٹھانے کی ضرورت ہی اسے اس لئے پیش آتی ہے کہ وہ ہلکا ہے۔ خود اسے اپنے اوپر اعتماد نہیں۔ نہ لوگوں کو ہے۔ اگرچہ بظاہر وہ دولتمند ہے ، جتھے دار ہے۔ لہٰذا ایک بادشاہ ، ایک مالدار اور ایک قوی اور جبار شخص بھی ہلکا ہوسکتا ہے۔ اس لئے کہ اہانت اور عزت دونوں نفسیاتی صفات ہیں۔ یہ کبھی انسانی شخصیت سے دور نہیں ہوتیں۔ ایک شریف انسان باوزن ہوتا ہے۔ اگرچہ دنیا کے دوسرے پہلوﺅں سے وہ کوئی بڑا آدمی نہ ہو۔</p><p>3۔ ھماز (86 : 11) (طعنے دینے والا) یہ شخص اقوال واشارات سے لوگوں کے عیب بیان کرتا ہے ، ان کے سامنے بھی اور ان کے پس پشت بھی۔ ایسے شخص کو اسلام بہت برا خیال کرتا ہے جو لوگوں کے عیب نکالتا ہے۔ یہ بات مروت کے خلاف ہے۔ اعلیٰ آداب کے بھی خلاف ہے ، نیز لوگوں کے ساتھ برتاﺅ لوگوں کے اکرام کے خلاف ہے ، خواہ بڑے ہوں یا چھوٹے ہوں۔ اس صفت کو قرآن کریم نے متعدد مقامات میں لیا ہے۔ اور اس کی سخت ممانعت کی ہے۔</p><p>ایک جگہ کہا گیا۔ ویل ................ لمزة (401 : 1) ” تباہی ہے ہر اس شخص کے لئے جو لوگوں پر طعن کرے اور برائیاں کرنے کا خوگر ہو “۔ اور دوسری جگہ ہے۔</p><p>یایھا الذین ............................ الایمان (94 : 11) ” اے لوگو جو ایمان لائے ہو نہ مرددوسرے مردوں کا مذاق اڑائیں ، ہوسکتا ہے کہ وہ ان سے بہتر ہوں۔ اور نہ عورتیں دوسری عورتوں کا مذاق اڑائیں ، ہوسکتا ہے کہ وہ ان سے بہتر ہوں۔ آپس میں ایک دوسرے پر طعن نہ کرو اور نہ ایک دوسرے کو برے القاب سے یاد کرو ، ایمان لانے کے بعد فسق میں نام پیدا کرنا بہت بری بات ہے “۔ یہ سب بدخونی اور چغل خوری کی اقسام ہیں۔</p><p>4۔ مشاء بنمیم (86 : 11) (چغلیاں کھاتا پھرتا ہے) وہ لوگوں کے درمیان ایسی باتیں پھیلاتا ہے جن سے ان کے دل میلے ہوں ، تعلقات ختم ہوں ، محبت ختم ہو ، یہ ایک ذلیل حرکت ہے اور ہلکے لوگ ایسا کام کیا کرتے ہیں۔ کوئی خوددار شخص اس قسم کی حرکت کا ارتکاب نہیں کیا کرتا جو یہ توقع کرتا ہو کہ لوگ اسے اچھی نظروں سے دیکھیں۔ یہاں تک کہ جو لوگ اس قسم کے شخص کی باتیں سنتے ہیں وہ بھی اسے اچھا نہیں سمجھتے۔ دل سے یہ لوگ بھی اسے برا سمجھتے ہیں اور یہ کہتے ہیں کہ کاش یہ شخص یہ بری بات انہیں نہ بتاتا۔</p><p>حضور اکرم ﷺ اس بات کو پسند نہ فرماتے تھے کہ آپ کو ایسی بات بتائی جائے جس سے آپ کا دل اپنے کسی صحابی سے خفا ہو۔ آپ فرماتے : ” کوئی شخص مجھے میرے ساتھی کی ایسی بات نہ بتائے کیونکہ میں پسند کرتا ہوں کہ میں تمہارے پاس نکلوں اور میرا دل تمہارے بارے میں صاف ہو “۔ (ابوداﺅ وغیرہ) صحیحین میں ہے : ” رسول اللہ ﷺ دو قبروں کے پاس سے گزرے اور فرمایا یہ دونوں عذاب میں مبتلا ہیں اور یہ کسی بڑے جرم میں سزاوار نہیں ہیں۔ ایک تو اس لئے کہ یہ پیشاب سے اپنے آپ کو بچاتا نہ تھا اور دوسرا چغل خور تھا “۔</p><p>امام احمد نے حضرت حذیفہ کی یہ حدیث نقل کی ہے ” جنت میں چغلی کھانے والا داخل نہ ہوگا “۔ (ابن ماجہ)</p><p>امام احمد نے بریدہ ابن الحکم کی روایت نقل کی ہے۔ حضور ﷺ نے فرمایا بتاﺅں میں کہ تم میں سے اچھا کون ہے ؟ صحابہ ؓ نے عرض کیا جی ہاں یارسول اللہ ! ” وہ لوگ جب ان کو دیکھا جائے تو خدا یاد آجائے “۔ پھر فرمایا کہ بتاﺅں کہ برے لوگ کون ہیں ؟ “۔ وہ جو چغلی کھاتے ہیں ، جو دوستوں کے درمیان دشمنی پیدا کرتے ہیں جو پاک دامن لوگوں میں ، عیب تلاش کرتے ہیں “۔</p><p>اسلام کے لئے اس قسم کی بری خصلت کی مذمت بہت ضروری تھی ، کیونکہ یہ خصلت مذموم ، گری ہوئی اور سوسائٹی میں فساد ڈالنے والی ہے ، جس طرح دوستوں میں فساد پیدا کرتی ہے اور اس قسم کے شخص کو ننگا کرنا ضروری تھا ، قبل اس کے کہ وہ اسلامی سوسائٹی کے اندر فساد پیدا کردے ، لوگوں کے دلوں کو ایک دوسرے سے بھر دے ، اور قبل اس سے کہ وہ سوسائٹی کی سلامتی کو نقصان پہنچائے۔ ایسے لوگ اکثر اوقات بےگناہ لوگوں کو نقصان پہنچاتے ہیں۔</p><p>5۔ مناع للخیر (86 : 21) (بھلائی سے روکنے والا) یعنی وہ بھلائی سے اپنے آپ کو بھی محروم کرتا ہے اور دوسروں کو بھی۔ یہ شخص لوگوں کو ایمان روکتا تھا ، حالانکہ ایمان بھلائی کا سرچشمہ ہوتا ہے۔ اس شخص کے بارے میں مشہور ہے کہ یہ شخص اپنی اولاد اور اہل خاندان سے کہا کرتا تھا : ” اگر تم میں سے کسی نے دین محمد کو قبول کیا تو میں اسے کبھی بھی نفع نہ پہنچاﺅں گا “۔ جس کے بارے میں اسے شک ہوتا کہ وہ دین اسلام کی طرف مائل ہے۔ یوں ان کو وہ اس طرح دھمکی دے کر ڈراتا تھا۔ یہی وجہ ہے کہ قرآن نے اس کی اس حرکت کو بھی ریکارڈ کردیا کہ وہ بھلائی سے روکنے والا ہے۔</p><p>6۔ معتد (86 : 21) (ظلم و زیادتی میں حد سے گزرنے والا ہے) حق اور عدل سے آگے بڑھ جاتا ہے۔ نبی ﷺ پر یہ شخص تعدی کرتا ، مسلمانوں پر ظلم کرتا ، اپنے خاندان والوں پر ظلم کرتا ، اور ان کو ہدایت اور دین حق سے روکتا۔ کسی پر ظلم کرنا بہت ہی بری حرکت ہے اور قرآن وسنت میں اس کی شخت ممانعت کی گئی ہے۔ اسلام ظلم کی ہر صورت کی بیخ کنی چاہتا ہے۔ یہاں تک کہ کھانے اور پینے میں بھی۔</p><p>کلوا ................ تطغوا ” جو رزق ہم نے تم کو دیا ہے اس میں سے پاکیزہ چیزیں کھاﺅ اور حد سے نہ گزرو “۔ عدل اور اعتدال اسلام کا بنیادی اصول اور اسلام کی نشانی ہے۔</p><p>7۔ اثیم (86 : 21) (بداعمال ہے) وہ برے اعمال کا ارتکاب کرتا ہے گویا اثم کی صفت اس کے ساتھ لازم ہوگئی ہے۔ پس یہ گنہگار ہے ، اور ہر قسم کے معاصی کا ارتکاب کرتا ہے۔ یہ صفت اس کے ساتھ لازم ہے۔ گویا اس کا مزاج ہی ایسا ہے کہ ہر برائی کا ارتکاب کرے۔</p><p>8۔ عتل (86 : 31) (جفاکار) یہ ایک لفظ ہے جو اپنے تلفظ اور مفہوم کی رنگارنگی کی وجہ سے کئی معانی دیتا ہے ، یہ ایک ایسا جامع مفہوم دیتا ہے کہ کئی الفاظ اس کو ادا نہیں کرسکتے۔ یہ کہا جاسکتا ہے کہ عتل کے معنی شخت اور خشک کے ہیں ، یعنی ظالم۔ اس کے یہ معنی بھی ہیں کہ بہت کھانے اور پینے والا ہے۔ اور سخت وحشی اور روکنے والا ہے ، اپنی مذموم طبیعت میں بیگانہ ہے۔ معاملات میں برا ہے۔</p><p>حضرت ابوالدرداء سے روایت ہے : ” عتل ، بڑے پیٹ والا ، کج خلق ، بہت کھانے والا ، بہت پینے والا ، دولت جمع کرنے والا ، اور بخیل وکنجوس ہوتا ہے “۔ لیکن لفظ عتل میں یہ سب مفہوم اس کی کرخت آواز ہی سے ظاہر ہوتے ہیں۔ یعنی وہ شخص جو مکارم اخلاق کے ہر پہلو سے کریمہ المنظر ہو۔</p><p>9۔ زنیم (86 : 31) ” بےاصل “ یہ اخلاق ذمیمہ کا خاتمہ ہے۔ یہ اسلام کے دشمنوں میں سے ایک دشمن کی صفات ہیں۔ حقیقت یہ ہے کہ اسلام کے دشمن ایسے ہی مکروہ لوگ ہوسکتے ہیں۔ زنیم اس شخص کو کہتے ہیں جو کسی قوم کے ساتھ لاحق ہوگیا ہو اور وہ دراصل ان میں سے نہ ہو ، یا یہ کہ ان میں اس کی نسب مشکوک ہو اور اس کے مفاہم میں یہ بھی ہے کہ جو شخص لوگوں میں خباثت ، ذلت اور شرارتوں میں بہت ہی مشہور ہو ، اسے بھی زنیم کہا جاتا ہے۔ دوسرا مفہوم زیادہ قریب ہے اور ولید ابن مغیرہ زیادہ فٹ آتا ہے۔ اگرچہ اس لفظ کا اطلاق اس پر ایسی صفت چسپاں کرتا ہے کہ قوم میں وہ ہلکا ہو جبکہ وہ زیادہ فخر کرنے والا اور اپنے آپ کو بڑا سمجھنے والا ہو۔</p>"

А всякий лжец непременно окажется презренным - подлым, лишенным мудрости, не желающим творить добро. Более того, все желания такого человека направлены на удовлетворение низменных страстей, которыми переполнена его подлая душа. Он является хулителем, потому что непрестанно пытается выявить в людях пороки, разносит сплетни и насмехается над окружающими. Он также является сплетником, потому что доносит одним людям о том, что говорят другие, дабы поссорить их друг с другом и посеять между ними вражду и ненависть. Он скупится на добро и не желает выплачивать из своего имущества предписанные Аллахом милостыню, искупительные пожертвования и закят. Он является преступником, который покушается на жизнь, состояние и честь людей. Он погряз в грехах и не выполняет своих обязанностей перед Аллахом. Он груб, злобен, лишен сострадания и не желает повиноваться истине. Он высокого мнения о себе, хотя в действительности он лишен тех качеств, которые могут принести добро ему или людям. Напротив, нрав его в высшей степени порочен, и ему не видать успеха и благополучия. Его удел - низость и клеймо зла, по которому люди будут узнавать его. Одним словом, Всевышний Аллах запретил повиноваться лжецам, расточающим свои клятвы, имеющим подлый характер и дурной нрав, особенно, если они склонны к самолюбованию и высокомерию и превозносятся над истиной и людьми, презрительно относятся к ним, распространяют слухи, сплетни и хулу и ослушаются Аллаха. Эти аяты были ниспосланы о некоторых язычниках, одним из которых был аль-Валид б. аль-Мугира. Он обладал большим состоянием и имел много сыновей. Однажды, когда ему прочли кораническое откровение, он сказал: «Это - лишь древние предания». Из-за своего богатства и большой семьи он преступил закон Аллаха и превознесся над истиной. Он отверг ее тогда, когда она сама открылась ему, и счел ее древними преданиями, в которые можно и верить, и не верить. Несмотря на это, обсуждаемые нами аяты в полной мере относятся ко всем, кто обладает подобными порочными качествами, потому что Коран ниспослан как истинное руководство для всех людей - как для тех, кто жил в первые годы его ниспослания, так и для их потомков. Некоторые коранические аяты ниспосылались по поводу того или иного человека, но заключали в себе всеобщий смысл. Благодаря этому правоверные и по сей день на примере отдельных личностей познают судьбу всех им подобных."

The preceding verses rebutted the criticisms of pagan Arabs levelled against Allah's Messenger and gave reasons why the charges are not only unfounded, but also absurd. The present set of verses mentions a story of the past and the unbelievers of Makkah are threatened with punishment. 'Testing them' could refer to the forthcoming story, in which the owners of a garden were blessed with Divine favours, but they behaved ungratefully. As a result, a punishment came upon them and the favours were destroyed. The greatest Divine favour upon the Makkans was the advent of the Holy Messenger t. Besides, their businesses flourished and they prospered. This was a test for them to see whether they would behave gratefully to Allah and believe in Him and in His Messenger ﷺ ، or whether they would obstinately persist in disbelief. In the other case, they should draw lessons from the story of the owners of the orchard, lest they be visited by a similar punishment on account of ingratitude. This interpretation would apply even in the case where these verses are taken as Makki, but most commentators take them to be Madani. The 'test' referred to here is the terrible famine that held Makkah in its grip, as a result of the Holy Prophet's prayer against them, for several years during which time people died of hunger and starvation, they were forced to eat carrion and leaves of trees till the Makkans begged the Holy Prophet ﷺ to pray for their deliverance from the scourge. This incident took place after the migration.</p><p>The Story of the Owners of a Garden</p><p>Some elders, such as Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، mentioned that this orchard was in Yemen. According to one version of Sayyidna Said Ibn Jubair's narration, it was about six miles away from San` a', the famous capital city of Yemen. Other scholars think that it was in Ethiopia [ formerly known as Abyssinia ] [ Ibn Kathir ]. They were from amongst the People of the Book. This incident took place a while after the Ascension of Sayyidna Isa (علیہ السلام) [ Qurtubi ].</p><p>They are referred to as the 'Owners of the Garden' in the above verse. The description of the story given in the verses indicates that they did not only have a garden, but they also had large tracts of land which they cultivated and had fields of crops. Possibly, side by side with the orchard there were tracts of cultivated land and fields of crops in between the trees. However, they were called the owners of the garden on account of the popularity of the garden. The incident is reported according to the narration of Muhammad Ibn Marwan on the authority of Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ as follows: There was a garden about two farsakhs (six miles) away from San` a' of Yemen. Its name was Darawan. This garden was set up by a pious and righteous person. His practice was to pick the fruits or harvest the crops with sickle. He would give some of the crop to the poor and indigent who gathered grains for themselves and did their living.</p><p>Likewise, when the crop was thrashed, and the grain separated from the chaff, he would leave the grain for the poor. So also when fruits were picked from the trees of the orchard, some fruits would fall down, and he would leave them for the indigent. For this reason, the poor always gathered at the orchard at the time of picking the fruit, and separating the grain from the chaff. When the righteous person passed away, he had three sons who inherited the orchard and crop-fields. They held a family meeting and discussed that their family has grown large, and the produce of the orchard and land is not sufficient for them. Therefore, it is no longer possible for them to spare any fruit or grain for the poor. According to other narratives, these boys, like other youngsters, felt that their father was a fool to give so much of fruits and grains to them. They thought it was necessary to put a stop to this. The rest of the story is told in the following verses of the Qur'an.</p><p>إِذْ أَقْسَمُوا لَيَصْرِ‌مُنَّهَا مُصْبِحِينَ (...when they had sworn an oath that they would pluck its fruits on the next morning, and did not make any exception (by saying 'insha'Allah' ).... 68:17-18). In other words, they swore that they would harvest very early in the morning and return with it before the throng of poor people could arrive at the garden. They had so much of confidence in their plan that they did not say the redeeming words 'If Allah wills' whereas it is sunnah to say 'insha'Allah' when one mentions that one will do a particular work tomorrow.</p>"

“দেখো, আমি তো তোমাদেরকে পূর্বেই বলেছিলাম যে, তোমরা কেন আল্লাহ্ তা'আলার পবিত্রতা ঘোষণা এবং প্রশংসা করছো না? এ কথা শুনে তারা বললোঃ আমাদের প্রতিপালক পবিত্র ও মহান। নিশ্চয়ই আমরা নিজেদের উপর যুলুম করেছি। যখন শাস্তি পৌছে গেল তখন তারা আনুগত্য স্বীকার করলো, যখন আযাব এসে পড়লো তখন তারা নিজেদের অপরাধ মেনে নিলো। অতঃপর তারা একে অপরকে তিরস্কার করতে লাগলো এবং বলতে থাকলো। আমরা বড়ই মন্দ কাজ করেছি যে, মিসকীনদের হক নষ্ট করতে চেয়েছি এবং আল্লাহ্ পাকের আনুগত্য করা হতে বিরত থেকেছি। তারপর তারা সবাই বললোঃ এতে কোন সন্দেহ নেই যে, আমাদের হঠকারিতা সীমা ছাড়িয়ে গেছে। এ কারণেই আমাদের উপর আল্লাহর আযাব এসে পড়েছে। অতঃপর তারা বললোঃ ‘সম্ভবতঃ আমাদের প্রতিপালক আমাদেরকে এর চেয়ে উত্তম বিনিময় প্রদান করবেন। অর্থাৎ দুনিয়াতেই তিনি আমাদেরকে এর চেয়ে ভাল বদলা দিবেন। অথবা এও হতে পারে যে, আখিরাতের ধারণায় তারা এ কথা বলেছিল। এসব ব্যাপারে আল্লাহ তা'আলাই সবচেয়ে ভাল জানেন। পূর্বযুগীয় কোন কোন গুরুজনের উক্তি এই যে, এটা ইয়ামনবাসীর ঘটনা। হযরত সাঈদ ইবনে জুবায়ের (রঃ) বলেন যে, এ লোকগুলো ছিল যারওয়ানের অধিবাসী যা (তৎকালীন ইয়ামনের রাজধানী) সানাআ হতে ছয় মাইল দূরবর্তী একটি গ্রাম। অন্যান্য মুফাসসির বলেন যে, এরা ছিল হাবশের অধিবাসী। মাযহাবের দিক দিয়ে তারা আহলে কিতাব ছিল। ঐ বাগানটি তারা তাদের পিতার নিকট হতে উত্তরাধিকার সূত্রে লাভ করেছিল। তাদের পিতার নীতি এই ছিল যে, বাগানে উৎপাদিত ফল ও শস্যের মধ্য হতে বাগানের খরচ বের করে এবং নিজের ও পরিবার পরিজনের সারা বছরের খরচ বের করে নিয়ে বাকীগুলো আল্লাহর নামে সাকা করে দিতেন। পিতার ইন্তেকালের পর তাঁর এই সন্তানরা পরস্পর পরামর্শ করে বললোঃ “আমাদের পিতা বড়ই নির্বোধ ছিলেন। তা না হলে তিনি এতোগুলো ফল ও শস্য প্রতি বছর এদিক-ওদিক দিয়ে দিতেন না। আমরা যদি এগুলো ফকীর মিসকীনদেরকে প্রদান না করি এবং তা যথারীতি সংরক্ষণ করি তবে অতি সত্বর আমরা ধনী হয়ে যাবো।” তারা তাদের এ সংকল্প দৃঢ় করে নিলো। ফলে তাদের উপর ঐ শাস্তি এসে পড়লো যা তাদের মূল সম্পদকেও ধ্বংস করে দিলো। তারা হয়ে গেল সম্পূর্ণ রিক্তহস্ত। এরপর আল্লাহ তাবারাকা ওয়া তা'আলা বলেনঃ শাস্তি এরূপই হয়ে থাকে। অর্থাৎ যে কেউই আল্লাহর হুকুমের বিরুদ্ধাচরণ করে এবং তাঁর নিয়ামতের মধ্যে কার্পণ্য করতঃ দরিদ্র ও অভাবগ্রস্তদের হক আদায় করে না, বরং তাঁর নিয়ামতের প্রতি অকৃতজ্ঞতা প্রকাশ করে, তার উপর এরূপই শাস্তি আপতিত হয়ে থাকে। এটা তো হলো পার্থিব শাস্তি, আখিরাতের শাস্তি তো এখনো বাকী রয়েছে যা কঠিনতর ও নিকৃষ্টতর। ইমাম বায়হাকী (রঃ) একটি হাদীস বর্ণনা করেছেন যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) রাত্রিকালে ফসল কাটতে এবং বাগানের ফল আহরণ করতে নিষেধ করেছেন।</p>"

The middle brother was the best of them. He was righteous like his father. It used to please him to spend in the cause of Allah. He was not niggardly or stingy like the other brothers. He had advised them to recite tasbih which, literally, means to pronounce Allah's purity. He told them that they were withholding the share of the poor with the fear that their fruit will be depleted and will not be replenished by Allah, if they gave the poor their share. He told them that Allah is pure from such pettiness. Instead, those who spend in the way of Allah, He will not only make their wealth full again or replace what they have spent, but also will give them over and above what they have spent.

The mercy and favor of sending of Muhammad ﷺ to them. But they met him with denial, rejection and opposition. Therefore Allah says,</p><p>إِنَّا بَلَوْنَـهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, We have tried them) meaning, `We have tested them.'</p><p>كَمَا بَلَوْنَآ أَصْحَـبَ الْجَنَّةِ</p><p>(as We tried the People of the Garden,) This refers to a garden containing different types of fruits and vegetation.</p><p>إِذْ أَقْسَمُواْ لَيَصْرِمُنَّهَا مُصْبِحِينَ</p><p>(when they swore to pluck the fruits of the (garden) in the morning,) meaning, they vowed between themselves during the night that they would pluck the fruit of the garden in the morning so that poor and the beggars would not know what they were doing. In this way they would be able to keep its fruit for themselves and not give any of it in charity.</p><p>وَلاَ يَسْتَثْنُونَ</p><p>(Without (saying: \"If Allah wills.\")) meaning their vow that they made. Therefore, Allah broke their vow. He then said,</p><p>فَطَافَ عَلَيْهَا طَآئِفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكَ وَهُمْ نَآئِمُونَ</p><p>(Then there passed over it a Ta'if from your Lord while they were asleep. ) meaning, it was afflicted with some heavenly destruction.</p><p>فَأَصْبَحَتْ كَالصَّرِيمِ</p><p>(So by the morning it became like As-Sarim.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Like the dark night.\" Ath-Thawri and As-Suddi both said, \"Like the crop when it is harvested withered and dry.\"</p><p>فَتَنَادَوْاْ مُصْبِحِينَ</p><p>(Then they called out (one to another as soon) as the morning broke.) meaning, when it was (early) morning time they called each other so that they could go together to pick the harvest or cut it (its fruits). Then Allah said,</p><p>أَنِ اغْدُواْ عَلَى حَرْثِكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـرِمِينَ</p><p>((Saying:) \"Go to your tilth in the morning, if you would pluck (the fruits).\") meaning, `if you want to pluck your harvest fruit.'</p><p>فَانطَلَقُواْ وَهُمْ يَتَخَـفَتُونَ</p><p>(So they departed, and they were whispering:) meaning, they spoke privately about what they were doing so that no one could hear what they were saying. Then Allah, the All-Knower of secrets and private discussions, explained what they were saying in private. He said,</p><p>فَانطَلَقُواْ وَهُمْ يَتَخَـفَتُونَ - أَن لاَّ يَدْخُلَنَّهَا الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّسْكِينٌ</p><p>(So they departed, and they were whispering: \"No poor person shall enter upon you into it today.\") meaning, some of them said to others, \"Do not allow any poor person to enter upon you in it (the garden) today.\" Allah then said,</p><p>وَغَدَوْاْ عَلَى حَرْدٍ</p><p>(And they went in the morning with Hard) meaning, with strength and power.</p><p>قَـدِرِينَ</p><p>(Qadirin) meaning, they thought they had power to do what they claimed and what they were desiring.</p><p>فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهَا قَالُواْ إِنَّا لَضَآلُّونَ</p><p>(But when they saw it, they said: \"Verily, we have gone astray.\") meaning, when they arrived at it and came upon it, and it was in the condition which Allah changed from that luster, brilliance and abundance of fruit, to being black, gloomy and void of any benefit. They believed that they had been mistaken in the path they took in walking to it. This is why they said,</p><p>إِنَّا لَضَآلُّونَ</p><p>(Verily, we have gone astray.) meaning, `we have walked down a path other than the one we were seeking to reach it.' This was said by Ibn `Abbas and others. Then they changed their minds and realized with certainty that it was actually the correct path. Then they said,</p><p>بَلْ نَحْنُ مَحْرُومُونَ</p><p>(Nay! Indeed we are deprived (of the fruits)!) meaning, `nay, this is it, but we have no portion and no share (of harvest).'</p><p>قَالَ أَوْسَطُهُمْ</p><p>(The Awsat among them said,) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah all said, \"This means the most just of them and the best of them.\"</p><p>أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَّكُمْ لَوْلاَ تُسَبِّحُونَ</p><p>(Did I not tell you, `Why do you not Tusabbihun') Mujahid, As-Suddi and Ibn Jurayj all said that,</p><p>لَوْلاَ تُسَبِّحُونَ</p><p>(Why do you not Tusabbihun) this means \"why do you not say, `If Allah wills\"' As-Suddi said, \"Their making exception due to the will of Allah in that time was by glorifying Allah (Tasbih).\" Ibn Jarir said, \"It is a person's saying, `If Allah wills.\"' It has also been said that it means that the best of them said to them, \"Did I not tell you, why don't you glorify Allah and thank Him for what He has given you and favored you with\"</p><p>قَالُواْ سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَـلِمِينَ</p><p>(They said: \"Glory to Our Lord! Verily, we have been wrongdoers.\") They became obedient when it was of no benefit to them, and they were remorseful and confessed when it was not of any use. Then they said,</p><p>إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَـلِمِينَفَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ يَتَلَـوَمُونَ</p><p>(\"...Verily, we have been wrongdoers.\" Then they turned one against another, blaming.) meaning, they started blaming each other for what they had resolved to do, preventing the poor people from receiving their right of the harvested fruit. Thus, their response to each other was only to confess their error and sin.</p><p>قَالُواْ يوَيْلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا طَـغِينَ</p><p>(They said: \"Woe to us! Verily, we were Taghin.\") meaning, `we have transgressed, trespassed, violated and exceeded the bounds until what this happened to us.'</p><p>عَسَى رَبُّنَآ أَن يُبْدِلَنَا خَيْراً مِّنْهَآ إِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا رَغِبُونَ</p><p>(We hope that our Lord will give us in exchange better than it. Truly, we hope in our Lord.) It has been said, \"They were hoping for something better in exchange in this life.\" It has also been said, \"They were hoping for its reward in the abode of the Hereafter.\" And Allah knows best. Some of the Salaf mentioned that these people were from Yemen. Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"They were from a village that was called Darawan which was six miles from San`a' (in Yemen). \" It has also been said, \"They were from the people of Ethiopia whose father had left them this garden, and they were from the People of the Book. Their father used to handle the garden in a good way. Whatever he reaped from it he would put it back into the garden as it needed, and he would save some of it as food for his dependants for the year, and he would give away the excess in charity. Then, when he died, and his children inherited the garden they said, `Verily, our father was foolish for giving some of this garden's harvest to the poor. If we prevent them from it, then we will have more.' So when they made up their minds to do this they were punished with what was contrary to their plan. Allah took away all of what they possessed of wealth, gain and charity. Nothing remained for them.\" Allah then says,</p><p>كَذَلِكَ الْعَذَابُ</p><p>(Such is the punishment,) meaning, such is the punishment of whoever opposes the command of Allah, is stingy with what Allah has given him and favored him with, withholds the right of the poor and needy, and responds to Allah's blessings upon him with ungratefulness (or disbelief).</p><p>وَلَعَذَابُ الاٌّخِرَةِ أَكْبَرُ لَوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(but truly, the punishment of the Hereafter is greater if they but knew.) meaning, this is the punishment in this life, as you have heard, and the punishment of the Hereafter is even harder.</p>"

After a brief reference to the famine faced by the Makkans and a detailed account of the People of the Garden whose garden was burnt as a punishment, the present verse sets down a general rule. When a Divine punishment visits, it visits in this way, and this kind of punishment in the mortal world does not serve as an expiation for the punishment in the Hereafter. The punishment of the Hereafter is greater and more severe.</p><p>The following verses give a description of the reward of the righteous, followed by refutation of another false claim of the pagans of Makkah. They denied that Resurrection will ever occur. They thought the story of Resurrection and accountability is fiction. Even if that does happen, they thought, they will get the same type of blessings and wealth as they have in this world. Several verses respond to their false belief. In verse [ 35] Allah poses the rhetorical question to the disbelievers: 'Shall We make the obedient like the sinners? [ 35] This is a strange sort of assertion for which they have no authority, nor proof nor any celestial book. Nor is there any promise from Allah that they will get the same type of blessings.</p><p>A Rational Proof of Resurrection</p><p>These verses give a solid proof to the necessity of the Day of Judgment, because accountability, rewarding the righteous and punishing the evil are all rationally necessary. It is witnessed by every person in this mortal world, and no one can deny, that the wicked, the evil, the unjust, the thieves and the bandits generally lead a comfortable and enjoyable life in the mortal world. A thief or a bandit sometimes in one night gains so much of wealth that a righteous person might not gain as much in his entire life. The former has no fear of Allah or the Hereafter, nor does he have any sense of shame. He fulfills his selfish desires as he likes - by hook or by crook. The latter fears Allah, and if he does not have that, his sense of shame among his brotherhood overwhelms him. In short, in the mortal world the wicked and the evil ones seem to be successful, and the good people seem to be unsuccessful. If there does not arise an occasion where fair play and justice is established - where the good people would be rewarded and the evil ones would be punished? It would be meaningless to refer to evil as evil. There would be no reason to stop a person from fulfilling his selfish desires and doing the evil acts. On the other hand, justice will have no meaning or significance. How will the believers in God's existence respond to the following question: Where is God's justice?</p><p>One may argue that a criminal is apprehended, he is exposed to disgrace and is punished. This distinguishes the innocent persons from the evil ones right here in this world. Laws and statutes of a government’ s establish standards of justice and fair play. But this is incorrect, because it is not possible for a government to keep an eye on every one, everywhere and in all circumstances. Wherever it does happen, it is not an easy task to gather the necessary judicial evidence, so that the guilty person may be convicted and punished. And even if the judicial evidence could be gathered, there are several escape doors through which the guilty person could get away, such as force, bribery, intercession and pressure. If we review the punishment history of the present-day governments and courts, it would appear that nowadays only those people are punished who are fools, brainless and helpless or without support. They are not cunning enough to find a loophole in the legal system, or an escape route, nor do they have enough money to pay for bribery, nor do they have an influential person to back them or intercede on their behalf or they cannot use these things because of their foolishness. The rest of the criminals are moving freely.</p>"

Kebi-jaksanaan Allah سبحانه وتعالى tidak menyamakan antara orang-orang yang bertakwa yang menunaikan hak-hak Rabb mereka, tunduk pada perintah-perintahNya dan yang meniti ridhaNya seperti orang-orang pendosa yang larut dalam kemaksiatan, mengkufuri ayat-ayatNya, membangkang rasul-rasulNya dan memerangi para kekasihNya. \nJika ada yang mengira balasan kedua golongan tersebut sama, tentu hukum yang berlaku tidak adil. Hukumnya batil dan pandangannya tidak benar. Jika para pendosa mengira demikian, mereka sama sekali tidak memiliki sandaran. Bukan kitab yang mereka pelajari dan baca yang menyebutkan bahwa mereka ada-lah penghuni surga, mereka mendapatkan apa saja yang mereka inginkan dan pilih, mereka juga tidak memiliki janji dan sumpah sempurna di sisi Allah سبحانه وتعالى pada Hari Kiamat bahwa mereka akan mendapatkan apa pun yang mereka putuskan, mereka juga tidak memiliki sekutu dan teman yang membantu mereka mendapatkan \napa yang mereka inginkan. Jika mereka memiliki sekutu dan te-man, silahkan mereka datangkan jika mereka adalah orang-orang yang benar. Sebagaimana diketahui, semua hal itu tidak ada. Me-reka tidak memiliki kitab dan janji di sisi Allah سبحانه وتعالى akan mendapat-kan keselamatan, mereka juga tidak memiliki sekutu yang akan menolong mereka. Maka dapat diketahui bahwa klaim mereka batil belaka. Allah سبحانه وتعالى berfirman, ﴾ سَلۡهُمۡ  أَيُّهُم   بِذَٰلِكَ   زَعِيمٌ  ﴿ \"Tanyakanlah kepada mereka, 'Siapakah di antara mereka yang bertanggung jawab terhadap keputusan yang diambil itu'.\" Maksudnya, siapa yang bertanggung jawab atas klaim yang jelas-jelas batil ini. Tidak akan ada seorang pun yang mau mengakui dan bertanggung jawab.                </div>"

            "text": "<h2>The Terror of the Day of Judgement</h2><p>After Allah mentions that those who have Taqwa, will have Gardens of Delight with their Lord, He explains when this will be, and its actual occurrence. He says,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُكْشَفُ عَن سَاقٍ وَيُدْعَوْنَ إِلَى السُّجُودِ فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ</p><p>(The Day when the Shin shall be laid bare and they shall be called to prostrate themselves, but they shall not be able to do so.) meaning, the Day of Judgement and the horrors, earthquakes, trials, tests and great matters that will occur during it. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that he heard the Prophet saying,</p><p>«يَكْشِفُ رَبُّنَا عَنْ سَاقِهِ، فَيَسْجُدُ لَهُ كُلُّ مُؤْمِنٍ وَمُؤْمِنَةٍ، وَيَبْقَى مَنْ كَانَ يَسْجُدُ فِي الدُّنْيَا رِيَاءً وَسُمْعَةً، فَيَذْهَبُ لِيَسْجُدَ، فَيَعُودُ ظَهْرُهُ طَبَقًا وَاحِدًا»</p><p>(Our Lord will reveal His Shin, and every believing male and female will prostrate to Him. The only people who will remain standing are those who prostrated in the worldly life only to be seen and heard (showing off). This type of person will try to prostrate at that time, but his back will made to be one stiff plate (the bone will not bend or flex).)\" This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs and other books from different routes of transmission with various wordings. It is a long Hadith that is very popular. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>خَـشِعَةً أَبْصَـرُهُمْ تَرْهَقُهُمْ ذِلَّةٌ</p><p>(Their eyes will be cast down and ignominy will cover them;) means, in the final abode, due to their crimes and arrogance in the worldly life. Thus they will be punished with the opposite of what they did. When they were called to prostrate in the worldly life, they refused to do so even though they were healthy and secure. Therefore, they will be punished with the lack of ability to do so in the Hereafter. When the Almighty Lord makes Himself visible (before the believers), then the believers will fall down in prostration to Him, but no one of the disbelievers and hypocrites will be able to prostrate. rather, their backs will become one plate. Everytime one of them attempts to prostrate, he will bow his neck but will not be able to prostrate. This is just like in the life of this world, when these people were in opposition to what the believers were doing.</p><h2>For Whoever denies the Qur'an</h2><p>Then Allah says,</p><p>فَذَرْنِى وَمَن يُكَذِّبُ بِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ</p><p>(Then leave Me alone with such as belie this narration.) meaning, the Qur'an. This is a sever threat which means, `leave Me alone with this person; I know about him and how I will gradually punish him and increase him in his falsehood. I am giving him respite for a while, then I will seize him with a mighty and powerful punishment.' Thus, Allah says,</p><p>سَنَسْتَدْرِجُهُم مِّنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(We shall punish them gradually from directions they perceive not.) meaning, and they will not even be aware of it. Rather, they will believe that it is a noble blessing from Allah, but really the same matter is actually a form of humiliation (for them). This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>أَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّمَا نُمِدُّهُمْ بِهِ مِن مَّالٍ وَبَنِينَ - نُسَارِعُ لَهُمْ فِى الْخَيْرَتِ بَل لاَّ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(Do they think that in wealth and children with which We expand them, We hasten unto them with good things. Nay, but they perceive not.) (23:55,56) Allah also said,</p><p>فَلَمَّا نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ حَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُواْ بِمَآ أُوتُواْ أَخَذْنَـهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ مُّبْلِسُونَ</p><p>(So, when they forgot that which they had been reminded, We opened for them the gates of everything, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We punished them, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.) Therefore, Allah says here,</p><p>وَأُمْلِى لَهُمْ إِنَّ كَيْدِى مَتِينٌ</p><p>(And I will grant them a respite. Verily, My plan is strong.) meaning, `I will delay them, give them respite and extend their time. Yet, this is My plan, and My plot against them.' Thus, Allah says,</p><p>إِنَّ كَيْدِى مَتِينٌ</p><p>(Verily, My plan is strong.) meaning, `great against whoever opposes My command, rejects My Messengers and dares to disobey Me.' In the Two Sahihs it is recorded from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ that he said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالى لَيُمْلِي لِلظَّالِمِ حَتْى إِذَا أَخَذَهُ لَمْ يُفْلِتْه»</p><p>(Verily Allah the Exalted gives respite to the wrongdoer until He seizes him and he will not be able to escape Him.) Then he recited,</p><p>وَكَذلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَى وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ</p><p>(Such is the punishment of your Lord when He seizes the towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His punishment is painful (and) severe.) (11:102) In reference to Allah's statement,</p><p>أَمْ تَسْـَلُهُمْ أَجْراً فَهُم مِّن مَّغْرَمٍ مُّثْقَلُونَ - أَمْ عِندَهُمُ الْغَيْبُ فَهُمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</p><p>(Or is it that you ask them for a wage, so that they are heavily burdened with debt Or that the Unseen is in their hands, so that they can write it down) the explanation of these two Ayat prece- ded in Surat At-Tur. The meaning of it is, `you, O Muhammad, call them to Allah without taking any wages from them. rather, you hope for the reward with Allah. Yet, they reject that which you have brought to them simply due to ignorance, disbelief and obstinacy.'</p><p>فَاصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ وَلاَ تَكُن كَصَـحِبِ الْحُوتِ إِذْ نَادَى وَهُوَ مَكْظُومٌ</p>"

(এটা কখনো নয়) বরং তারা বুঝে না।\" (২৩:৫৫-৫৬) আল্লাহ পাক অন্যত্র বলেনঃ (আরবি)অর্থাৎ “যখন তারা আমার ওয়ায ও নসীহত ভুলে বসে তখন আমি তাদের জন্যে সব জিনিসের দরজা উন্মুক্ত করে দিই, অতঃপর যখন তারা এজন্যে ঔদ্ধত্য ও অহংকার প্রকাশ করতে থাকে তখন অকস্মাৎ আমি তাদেরকে পাকড়াও করি, ফলে তাদের সব আশা আকাঙ্ক্ষা ব্যর্থতায় পর্যবসিত হয়।” (৬:৪৪) আর এখানে মহাপরাক্রমশালী আল্লাহ বলেনঃ আমি তাদেরকে সময় দিয়ে থাকি, আমার কৌশল অত্যন্ত বলিষ্ঠ। সহীহ বুখারী ও সহীহ মুসলিমে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “আল্লাহ তা'আলা অত্যাচারীদেরকে অবকাশ দেন, অতঃপর যখন ধরেন তখন আর ছেড়ে দেন না।\" তারপর তিনি নিম্নের আয়াতটি পাঠ করেনঃ (আরবি)অর্থাৎ “তোমার প্রতিপালকের পাকড়াও এরূপই। যখন তিনি কোন অত্যাচারী জনপদকে পাকড়াও করেন, তখন তাঁর পাকড়াও কঠিন যন্ত্রণাদায়ক হয়ে থাকে।” (১১:১০২)এরপর মহামহিমান্বিত আল্লাহ বলেনঃ হে নবী (সঃ)! তুমি তো তাদের কাছে কোন পারিশ্রমিক চাচ্ছ না যা তাদের উপর খুবই ভারী বোধ হচ্ছে? যার ভার বহন করতে তারা একেবারে ঝুঁকে পড়ছে? তাদের কি অদৃশ্যের জ্ঞান আছে যে, তারা তা লিখে রাখে। এ দু’টি বাক্যের তাফসীর সূরা তুরে বর্ণিত হয়েছে। ভাবার্থ হচ্ছেঃ হে নবী (সঃ)! তুমি তো তাদেরকে মহামহিমান্বিত আল্লাহর পথে আহ্বান করছো বিনা পারিশ্রমিকে! তাদের কাছে তো তুমি এর বিনিময়ে কোন ধন-সম্পদ যাচঞা করছে না। পুণ্য লাভ করা ছাড়া তোমার তো অন্য কোন উদ্দেশ্য নেই! তথাপিও এ লোকগুলো তোমাকে অবিশ্বাস করতে রয়েছে! এর একমাত্র কারণ হচ্ছে তাদের অজ্ঞতা ও ঔদ্ধত্যপনা।</p>"

Ikan yang menelannya kemudian memuntahkannya di tanah tandus dan Yunus dalam keadaan sakit. Allah سبحانه وتعالى menumbuhkan tanaman untuknya sejenis labu. Karena itu dalam surat ini Allah سبحانه وتعالى berfirman, ﴾</span> لَّوۡلَآ   أَن  تَدَٰرَكَهُۥ  نِعۡمَةٞ     مِّن   رَّبِّهِۦ  لَنُبِذَ  بِٱلۡعَرَآءِ  <span class=\"brown\">﴿ \"Kalau sekiranya ia tidak segera mendapat nikmat dari Rabb-nya, benar-benar ia dicampakkan ke tanah tandus,\" maksudnya, tentu akan dilemparkan ke tanah kering kerontang, ﴾</span> وَهُوَ    مَذۡمُومٞ   <span class=\"brown\">﴿ \"dalam keadaan tercela.\" Tapi Allah سبحانه وتعالى meliputinya dengan rahmat, Yunus pun dilemparkan dalam keadaan terpuji sehingga kondisinya lebih baik dari sebelumnya. Karena itu Allah سبحانه وتعالى berfirman, ﴾</span> فَٱجۡتَبَٰهُ  رَبُّهُۥ   <span class=\"brown\">﴿ \"Lalu Rabbnya memilihnya,\" yakni, Allah سبحانه وتعالى memilihnya dan menyu-cikannya dari segala kotoran, ﴾</span> فَجَعَلَهُۥ  مِنَ  ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ  ﴿ \"dan menjadikannya ter-masuk orang-orang yang shalih,\" yakni, orang-orang yang perbuatan, perkataan, niat, dan kondisinya baik.                </div><div lang=\"ms\" class=\"ms \">\n<span class=\"green\">(51-52)</span> Nabi kita, Muhammad a melaksanakan perintah Rabbnya dan bersabar atas ketetapanNya dengan kesabaran yang tidak bisa ditandingi oleh seorang pun dari seluruh alam.

We will draw them on little by little (towards Hell) from a way they do not know.... 68:44). Here the phrase 'So, leave me alone' in the original Arabic is an idiomatic expression which signifies 'Rely on Allah'. The disbelievers often demanded Divine punishment arguing that if they are really guilty in the sight of Allah, and if He has the power to punish, then why the punishment does not befall them forthwith. These were heart-rending demands on account of which the thought probably must have crossed the mind of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and he might have prayed to Allah to punish them sometime, in the hope that the rest of the people might draw lessons and amend their conduct. On that occasion, Allah revealed [ in verse, 45] that He is the best aware of the wisdom behind His decisions. He does not punish them immediately, but He gives them respite to test them and to give them an opportunity to believe.</p><p>Towards the end, the story of Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) is concisely told that when his people constantly demanded punishment, he became indignant and prayed for the punishment to be sent down. The signs of the punishment started appearing. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) left the place and transferred himself elsewhere. In the meantime the entire nation wept, wailed, sincerely repented and begged refuge from the Divine punishment. Allah pardoned them and took away the punishment. Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) felt embarrassed and thought that if he goes back to his people, they might think he was a liar. As a result, without the clear permission of Allah, he acted purely on his ijtihad [ independent judgment ] that he would not go back to his people. At this, Allah, in order to caution him, created a situation where he had to undertake sea voyage, and then was lowered into the sea where he was swallowed up by a fish. Being thus cautioned, Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) sought the Divine pardon. Consequently, Allah once again opened the doors of the former blessings to be restored to him. Full description of the event has been given in Surah Yunus (Verse 10:98) and other Surahs. The Holy Prophet ﷺ is comforted by this story not to be impressed by people's demands nor to be anxious to get them punished hastily. Allah's wisdom is profound and unfathomable. Allah alone knows what is in the best interests of the world. Allah should be trusted and relied on.</p>"

Zaten güzel âkıbet hep takvâ sahiplerinindir. Düşmanlarının onun hakkında ulaştıkları sonuç ise kendilerinin hoşuna gitmeyecek şeylerden ibaretti. Hatta onlar, gözleri ile ayağını kaydırıp onu devirmeye çalıştılar. Yani kıskançlıklarından, ona duydukları kin ve öfkelerinden dolayı ona nazarları değsin istediler. İşte fiili olarak ona verebilecekleri eziyet en fazla bu kadardı. Zira onu koruyan ve ona yardım eden Allah’tı.

مضبوط ہے۔ حضور اکرم ﷺ سے کہا جاتا ہے کہ چھوڑ دیجئے ان نٹ پونجیوں کو جو اس عظیم کلام کی تکذیب کرتے ہیں۔ میں ان سے لڑوں گا۔ یہ کون تھا جو تکذیب کرتا تھا ؟ یہ وہی انسان ہے جس کی قوت ایک چیونٹی سے بھی کم ہے۔ بلکہ اس پوری کائنات کی نسبت سے یہ تو ایک ذرے کے برابر بھی نہیں ہے جو ہوا میں اڑرہا ہے۔ اللہ قہار وجبار کی قوت کے مقابلے میں ، اس کی عظمت کے مقابلے میں انسان بیچارہ ہے کیا ؟</p><p>محمد (ﷺ) تم ان کو میرے لئے چھوڑدو ، آپ اور اہل ایمان آرام و اطمینان سے بیٹھیں ، یہ جنگ میرے ساتھ ہے ، میرے دین کی وجہ سے ہے۔ یہ لوگ میرے دشمن ہیں۔ میں ان کے معاملے کو اپنے ہاتھ میں لے رہا ہوں ، ان کو معلوم ہوجائے گا۔ آپ لوگ آرام و اطمینان سے بیٹھ جائیں۔ کس قدر خوفناک دھمکی ہے۔ اور کس قدر باوثوق یقین دہانی ہے ، ان لوگوں کو جو اس وقت نہایت ہی کمزور پوزیشن میں ہیں۔ اور یہ محض یقین دہانی ہی نہیں ہے۔ اللہ جبار وقہار بتلا دیتا ہے کہ ان کے خلاف کیا سٹریجی اختیار کی جائے گی۔ یہ تو بہت ہی کمزور ہیں اور ضعیف ہیں۔</p><p>سنستدرجھم ................ متین (54) (86 : 44۔ 54) “ ہم ایسے طریقہ سے ان کو بتدریج تباہی کی طرف سے جائیں گے کہ ان کو خبر بھی نہ ہوگی۔ میں ان کی رسی دراز کررہا ہوں ، میری چال بڑی زبردست ہے “۔ ان مکذبین اور تمام روئے زمین کے باشندے اس سے فروتر ہیں کہ اللہ ان کے بارے میں کوئی تدبیر کرے۔ لیکن اللہ تعالیٰ ان کو اپنی قوتوں سے ڈراتا ہے کہ وہ اللہ کے غضب کو دعوت نہ دیں۔ اور وقت کے چلے جانے سے پہلے ہی ، اپنے آپ کو درست کرلیں ، اور یہ جان لیں کہ یہ ظاہری عافیت جس میں وہ ہیں ، یہ بھی ان کے لئے بڑی فتح ہے جس پر وہ غرور کررہے ہیں۔ اور یہ کہ ان کو جو ظلم کرنے ، سرکشی کرنے ، دین اسلام سے منہ موڑنے ، اور گمراہی اختیار کرنے کی جو مہلت دے دی گئی ہے ، یہ دراصل مزید برے انجام کی تدبیر ہے۔ یہ اللہ کی تدبیر ہے کہ یہ لوگ اپنے بوجھ پورے کے پورے اٹھائیں اور قیامت میں جب آئیں تو گناہوں سے لدے ہوئے ہوں اور شرمندگی ، سرزنش اور عذاب میں ڈالے جانے کے مستحق ہوچکے ہوں۔</p><p>اللہ نے جو تدبیر کی ہوئی ہے ، اس میں بھی اللہ نہایت ہی عارلانہ اور رحیمانہ انداز اپناتا ہے کہ ان کو پہلے سے بتا دیتا ہے ، حالانکہ وہ اس کے دین کے دشمن ہیں ، رسول اللہ ﷺ کے دشمن ہیں تاکہ وہ غور کرلیں اور اگر چاہیں تو راہ راست پر آجائیں۔</p><p>اللہ تعالیٰ مہلت تو دیتا ہے لیکن یونہی شتر بےمہار نہیں چھوڑتا۔ جب وہ ظالموں کو پکڑتا ہے تو اس کی پکڑ سے پھر کوئی بچ نہیں سکتا۔ یہاں اللہ اپنے طریقے ، اپنی سنت اور اپنی مشیت بتاتا ہے اور رسول اللہ ﷺ کو بتاتا ہے کہ جو لوگ اس کلام کا انکار کرتے ہیں ان کو ذرا چھوڑیں کہ میں کس طرح انجام تک پہنچاتا ہوں۔ یہ لوگ مال ، اولاد اور مرتبہ ومقام پر اتراتے ہیں۔ میں ان کو مہلت دیتا ہوں۔ یہ نعمتیں ہی ان کے لئے باعث عذاب ہوں گی۔ یوں رسول اللہ ﷺ کو مطمئن کردیا جاتا ہے اور ان کو عذاب کے منہ میں جانے کے لئے چھوڑ دیا جاتا ہے۔</p><p>یہ انداز تعبیر نہایت معنی خیز ، خوفناک اور عجیب ہے۔</p><p>فذرنی ................ الحدیث (86 : 44) چھوڑ دو مجھے اور ان لوگوں کو جو اس کلام کی تکذیب کرتے ہیں “۔ میرے اور ان احمقوں کے درمیان اب گویا جنگ شروع ہوگئی ہے اور ایسے لوگوں کے ساتھ ہمیشہ اللہ کی جنگ رہی ہے۔ اس اعلان کے ذریعہ اللہ تعالیٰ مسلمانوں کے ذہن میں یہ بات بٹھاتا ہے کہ معرکہ ایمان وکفر ، معرکہ حق و باطل میں ، دراصل تم فریق نہیں ہو۔ ایک فریق یہ احمق ہیں اور دوسرا اللہ ہے۔ اس جنگ کی کمان اللہ کے اپنے ہاتھ میں ہے۔</p><p>اور یہ بات دراصل ہے بھی حقیقت ، اگرچہ بظاہر رسول اللہ ﷺ اور صحابہ کرام ؓ معرکہ حق و باطل میں اہم کردار نظر آتے ہیں ، ان کا جو کردار ہے وہ بھی سنت الٰہیہ اور تقدیر الٰہی کی تدبیر کا ایک حصہ ہے۔ رسول اللہ اور مسلمان تو دست قدرت کے آلات کار تھے ، یہ اللہ ہی تھا جو انہیں استعمال کرتا تھا۔ وہ فعال لمایرید ہے جو چاہتا ہے ، کرتا ہے اور کراتا ہے۔ کام اللہ خود کرتا ہے۔</p><p>جب یہ آیات نازل ہوئیں تو حضور ﷺ مکہ میں تھے اور مکہ کے بھی ابتدائی ایام تھے۔ مسلمان نہایت ہی قلیل تعداد میں تھے ، ضعیف تھے۔ یوں اللہ نے ان کے کاسہ دل کو اطمینان سے بھر دیا اور یوں ان لوگوں کو خوفزدہ کردیا جو قوت ، مال ، مرتبے اور اولاد کی وجہ سے غرے میں مبتلا تھے۔ اس کے بعد جب حضور ﷺ مدینہ گئے تو وہاں ظاہری حالات بدل گئے۔ اللہ نے یہ چاہا کہ رسول اللہ اور مسلمانوں کا اس معرکہ میں ایک ظاہری کردار بھی ہو۔ لیکن اصل حقیقت اللہ نے ہمیشہ دو ٹوک الفاظ میں بتائی جہاں وہ مکہ میں ضعیف تھے ، تب بھی اور مدینہ میں وہ بظاہر کامیاب اور طاقتور تھے تب بھی۔ بدر میں کہا۔</p><p>فلم تقتلوھم ................ سمیع علیم (8 : 71) ” پس حقیقت یہ ہے کہ تم نے انہیں قتل نہیں کیا بلکہ اللہ نے انہیں قتل کیا اور اے نبی تونے نہیں پھینکا بلکہ اللہ نے پھینکا (اور مومنوں کے ہاتھ جو اس کام میں استعمال کیے گئے) تو یہ اس لئے تھا کہ اللہ مومنوں کو ایک بہترین آزمائش سے کامیابی کے ساتھ گزار دے ، یقینا اللہ سننے اور جاننے والا ہے “ تاکہ ان کے دلوں میں یہ حقیقت بیٹھ جائے کہ جنگ کا فریق دراصل اللہ ہے۔ اور یہ جنگ اس کی جنگ ہے ، تاکہ اس آزمائش میں اللہ کے لئے اجر لکھ دے۔ رہی اصل جنگ تو وہ اللہ کی ہے اور رہی فتح تو وہ بھی اللہ عطا کرتا ہے ، مسلمانوں کے بغیر بھی یہ فتح اللہ عطا کرسکتا ہے۔ رہے یہ لوگ جو اس میں شریک ہوتے ہیں تو یہ دست قدرت کے آلات ہوتے ہیں۔ اور اللہ کی افواج صرف مومنین تک محدود نہیں ہیں۔</p><p>بہرحال قرآنی آیات میں اس حقیقت کو بالکل واضح کرکے بیان کیا ہے ، خواہ بظاہر مسلمان کمزور ہوں یا مضبوط ، نیز اللہ کے نظام قضا وقدر کے ساتھ بھی یہی بات متفق ہے۔ اللہ کی سنت اور اللہ کی مشیت کا بھی یہی تقاضا ہے۔ رہے مسلمان اور اسلامی افواج تو وہ محض آلات اور اسباب ہیں۔</p><p>یہ وہ حقیقت ہے جو مومن کو حالت قوت اور ضعف دونوں میں مطمئن کردیتی ہے بشرطیکہ قلب مومن مخلص ہو ، اور جہاد میں وہ اللہ پر بھروسہ کرتا ہو ، کیونکہ کفر واسلام کے معرکوں میں مسلمانوں کی قوت فیصلہ کن نہیں ہوتی بلکہ اللہ کی نصرت فیصلہ کن ہوتی ہے۔ اللہ نصرت کا ضامن بن جاتا ہے۔ اگر مسلمان ضعیف بھی ہوں تو بھی فتح پاتے ہیں کیونکہ ان کو اللہ کی تائید حاصل ہوتی ہے۔ ہاں اللہ دشمنوں کو مہلت دیتا ہے۔ ان کی رسی دراز کرتا ہے۔ اور اپنی مشیت ، حکمت ، اور عدل اور رحمت کے مطابق اپنے مناسب وقت پر اپنے دشمنوں کو شکست دیتا ہے۔</p><p>نیز یہ ایک ایسی حقیقت بھی ہے جس سے اللہ کے دشمنوں کے دل بھی تھر تھر کانپتے ہیں۔ چاہے مسلمان حالت ضعف میں ہوں یا حالت قوت میں ہوں۔ اس لئے کہ دشمن اسلام بھی جانتا ہے کہ ہمارا مقابلہ مسلمانوں سے نہیں بلکہ خدا سے ہے۔ اس خدا سے جو اپنے نبی سے کہہ رہا ہے۔</p><p>فذرنی .................... الحدیث (86 : 44) ” چھوڑدو مجھے اور اس شخص کو جو اس کلام کی تکذیب کرتا ہے “۔ تم الگ ہوجاﺅ اور اس بد بخت کو میرے لئے چھوڑ دو لیکن اللہ کی چال زبردست اور اس کا جال نظر فریب ہوتا ہے۔ یہ اس میں اس طرح پھنس جائیں گے کہ پتہ بھی نہ چلے گا۔ اگر چہ یہ طاقتور ہوں۔ یہ ان لوگوں کی توقت جس کی وجہ سے یہ غرے میں مبتلا ہیں یہی ان کے لئے موجب شکست ہوگی۔</p>"

তার। সুসময়ের সৎকার্যাবলীর ভিত্তিতে তাঁকে এই কঠিন অবস্থা হতে মুক্তি দান করুন!” তখন মহান আল্লাহ মাছকে আদেশ করলেনঃ “তুমি তাকে উগলিয়ে দাও।” মাছ তখন তাকে সমুদ্রের ধারে নিয়ে গিয়ে উগলিয়ে দিলো।এখানে মহামহিমান্বিত আল্লাহ বলেনঃ পুনরায় তার প্রতিপালক তাকে মনোনীত করলেন এবং তাকে সৎকর্মপরায়ণদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত করলেন।মুসনাদে আহমাদে হযরত আবদুল্লাহ (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “কারো জন্যে এটা উচিত নয় যে, সে বলে ও আমি ইউনুস ইবনে মাত্তা (আঃ) হতে উত্তম।” (এ হাদীসটি সহীহ বুখারী ও সহীহ মুসলিমে আৰ দুবাইরা (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত হয়েছে)আল্লাহ তা'আলা বলেনঃ কাফিররা যখন কুরআন শ্রবণ করে তখন তারা যেন তাদের তীক্ষ দৃষ্টি দ্বারা তোমাকে আছড়িয়ে ফেলে দিবে। অর্থাৎ হে নবী!তোমার প্রতি হিংসার বশবর্তী হয়ে এই কাফিররা তোমাকে তাদের তীক্ষ্ণ দৃষ্টি দ্বারা আছড়িয়ে ফেলতে চায়। তোমার প্রতি আল্লাহর পক্ষ হতে করুণা বর্ষিত না হলে অবশ্যই তারা তোমাকে আছাড় দিয়ে ফেলে দিতো। এই আয়াতে ঐ বিষয়ের উপর দলীল রয়েছে যে, নযর লাগা এবং আল্লাহর হুকুমে ওর প্রতিক্রিয়া হওয়া সত্য। যেমন বহু হাদীসেও রয়েছে, যা কয়েকটি সনদে বর্ণিত হয়েছে। সুনানে আবী দাউদে হযরত আনাস (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “ঝাড়-ফুঁক করা শুধু বদ নযরের জন্যে, বিষাক্ত জন্তুর কামড়ের জন্যে এবং অনবরত প্রবাহমান রক্তের জন্যে।” কোন কোন সনদে নযর শব্দটি নেই। (এ হাদীসটি সুনানে ইবনে মাজাহ, সহীহ মুসলিম এবং জামে তিরমিযীতেও রয়েছে)মুসনাদে আবি ইয়ালার একটি দুর্বল হাদীসে রয়েছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “আল্লাহর হুকুমে (বদ) নযর মানুষকে পতিত করে থাকে।”মুসনাদে আহমাদে হযরত হাবিস নামীমী (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “হাম’ ও নযরের মধ্যে কোনই সত্যতা নেই। সবচেয়ে বেশী সত্যতা রয়েছে লক্ষণ দেখে শুভাশুভ নিরূপণ বা ভাল ভবিষ্যৎ কথনের মধ্যে।” (এ হাদীসটি জামে তিরমিযীতেও বর্ণিত হয়েছে এবং ইমাম তিরমিযী (রঃ) এটাকে গারীব বা দুর্বল বলেছেন)মুসনাদে আহমাদে হযরত আবূ হুরাইরা (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “হাম' ও (বদ) নযরের মধ্যে কোন ক্ষতি নেই এবং লক্ষণ দেখে শুভাশুভ নিরূপণ বা ভাল ভবিষ্যৎ কথনই হলো সবচেয়ে সত্য। মুসনাদে আহমাদে হযরত ইবনে আব্বাস (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “(বদ) নযর সত্য, (বদ) নযর সত্য। এটা সমুন্নত ব্যক্তিকেও নীচে নামিয়ে দেয়।” (এটা গারীব বা দুর্বল)সহীহ মুসলিমে হযরত ইবনে আব্বাস (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, নবী (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “নযর সত্য, তকদীরের উপর কোন কিছু জয়যুক্ত হলে তা এই নযরই হতো। তোমাদেরকে গোসল করানো হলে তোমরা গোসল করে নিবে।” মুসনাদে আবদির রাযযাকে হযরত ইবনে আব্বাস (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) নিম্ন লিখিত কালেমা দ্বারা হযরত হাসান (রাঃ) ও হযরত হুসাইন (রাঃ)-এর জন্যে আশ্রয় প্রার্থনা করতেনঃ (আরবি)অর্থাৎ “আমি তোমাদের দু'জনের জন্যে আল্লাহর পরিপূর্ণ কালেমা দ্বারা প্রত্যেক শয়তান হতে এবং প্রত্যেক বিষাক্ত জন্তু হতে আশ্রয় প্রার্থনা করছি। আরো আশ্রয় প্রার্থনা করছি প্রত্যেক (বদ) নযর হতে যা লেগে যায়।\" তিনি বলতেনঃ হযরত ইবরাহীম (আঃ) এ শব্দগুলো দ্বারা হযরত ইসহাক (আঃ) ও হযরত ইসমাঈল (আঃ) এর জন্যে আশ্রয় প্রার্থনা করতেন। (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম বুখারী (রঃ) এবং আহলুস সুনানও বর্ণনা করেছেন)সুনানে ইবনে মাজাহতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, হযরত সাহল ইবনে হানীফ (রাঃ) গোসল করছিলেন। হযরত আমির ইবনে রাবীআহ (রাঃ) বলে উঠলেনঃ “আমি তো আজ পর্যন্ত কোন পর্দানশীঠ মহিলারও এরূপ (সুন্দর) পদনালী দেখিনি!” একথার অল্পক্ষণ পরেই হযরত সাহল অজ্ঞান হয়ে পড়ে যান। জনগণ তখন রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-এর নিকট গিয়ে বলেনঃ “হে আল্লাহর রাসূল (সঃ)! সাহল (রাঃ)-এর একটু খবর নিন, তিনি অজ্ঞান হয়ে আছেন।” রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) তাদেরকে বললেনঃ “তোমাদের কারো উপর সন্দেহ আছে কি?” তারা জবাবে বললেনঃ “হ্যাঁ, আমির ইবনে রাবীআহর (রাঃ) উপর সন্দেহ আছে। তিনি তখন বললেনঃ “তোমাদের মধ্যে কেউ কেন তার ভাইকে হত্যা করে? যখন তোমাদের কেউ তার ভাই এর কোন এমন জিনিস দেখবে যা তাকে খুব ভাল লাগবে তখন তার উচিত হবে তার জন্যে বরকতের দুআ করা। তারপর তিনি পানি আনতে বললেন এবং আমীর (রাঃ)-কে বললেনঃ “তুমি অযু কর এবং মুখমণ্ডল, কনুই পর্যন্ত হাত, হাঁটু এবং লুঙ্গীর মধ্যস্থিত দেহের অংশ ধৌত কর এবং ঐ পানি তার উপর ঢেলে দাও।” অন্য রিওয়াইয়াতে আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেনঃ বরতনকে তার পৃষ্ঠের পিছনে উল্টিয়ে দাও।' (এ হাদীসটি সুনানে নাসাঈতেও বর্ণিত হয়েছে) হযরত আবূ সাঈদ খুদরী (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) দানব ও মানবের বদ নযর হতে আশ্রয় প্রার্থনা করতেন। যখন সূরা ফালাক ও সূরা নাস অবতীর্ণ হলো তখন এ দুটোকে গ্রহণ করে অন্যান্য সবগুলোকে ছেড়ে দিলেন। (এ হাদীসটি সুনানে ইবনে মাজাহ, জামে তিরমিযী ও সুনানে নাসাঈতে বর্ণিত হয়েছে) মুসনাদে আহমাদে হযরত আবূ সাঈদ (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, হযরত জিবরাঈল (আঃ) নবী (সঃ)-এর নিকট এসে বলেনঃ “হে মুহাম্মাদ (সঃ)! আপনি কি অসুস্থ?” তিনি উত্তরে বলেনঃ “হ্যাঁ” তখন হযরত জিবরাঈল (আঃ) বলেনঃ (আরবি) অর্থাৎ “আল্লাহর নামে আমি আপনাকে ঝাড়-ফুঁক করছি প্রত্যেক জিনিস হতে যা আপনাকে কষ্ট দেয় এবং প্রত্যেক নফস ও চক্ষুর অনিষ্ট হতে যে আপনার ক্ষতি সাধন করে, আল্লাহ আপনাকে আরোগ্য দান করুন, আল্লাহর নামে আমি আপনাকে ঝাড় ফুঁক করছি। (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম মুসলিম (রঃ) এবং ইমাম আবূ দাউদ (রঃ) ছাড়া অন্যান্য আহলুস সুনানও বর্ণনা করেছেন) কোন কোন রিওয়াইয়াতে শব্দের কিছু হের ফেরও রয়েছে।সহীহ বুখারী ও সহীহ মুসলিমে হযরত আবূ হুরাইরা (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “নিশ্চয়ই নযর লেগে যাওয়া সত্য।” মুসনাদে আহমাদের একটি হাদীসে এরপরে এও রয়েছেঃ “এর কারণ হচ্ছে শয়তান এবং ইবনে আদমের হিংসা।\" মুসনাদে আহমাদে হযরত মুহাম্মাদ ইবনে কায়েস (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, হযরত আবূ হুরাইরা (রাঃ)-কে প্রশ্ন করা হয়ঃ “ভাবী শুভাশুভের নিদর্শন ঘর, ঘোড়া ও স্ত্রীলোক এ তিনটির মধ্যে রয়েছে এটা কি আপনি রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) হতে শুনেছেন?” উত্তরে হযরত আবূ হুরাইরা (রাঃ) বলেনঃ “আমি যদি শুনেছি বলি তবে তো আমার এমন কথা বলা হবে যা রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেননি। হ্যাঁ, তবে আমি রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-কে বলতে শুনেছিঃ “সর্বাপেক্ষা বড় সত্য হলো লক্ষণ দেখে শুভাশুভ নিরূপণ বা ভাল ভবিষ্যত কথন এবং নযর লেগে যাওয়াও সত্য।”হযরত উবায়েদ ইবনে রিফাআহ যারকী (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, হযরত আসমা (রাঃ) জিজ্ঞেস করেনঃ “হে আল্লাহর রাসূল (সঃ)! জাফর (রাঃ)-এর সন্তানদেরকে (বদ) নযর লেগে থাকে, সুতরাং আমি কোন ঝাড়-ফুঁক করাবো কি?” উত্তরে রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বললেনঃ “হ্যাঁ, যদি কোন জিনিস তকদীরের উপর জয়যুক্ত হতো তবে তা হতো এই (বদ) নযর।” (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম আহমাদ (রঃ), ইমাম তিরমিযী (রঃ) এবং ইমাম ইবনে মাজাহ (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)হযরত আয়েশা (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) তাঁকে বদ নযর হতে ঝাড়-ফুঁক করার নির্দেশ দিয়েছেন। (এ হাদীসটি ইবনে মাজাহ (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)হযরত আয়েশা (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত, তিনি বলেনঃ যে নযর লাগাতো তাকে অযু করার নির্দেশ দেয়া হতো, আর যার উপর নযর লাগানো হতো তাকে ঐ পানি দ্বারা গোসল করানো হতো। (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম আবূ দাউদ (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)হযরত আবূ হুরাইরা (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “বিষাক্ত জন্তু ও (বদ) নযর সত্য। আর সবচেয়ে বড় সত্য হলো লক্ষণ দেখে শুভাশুভ নিরূপণ বা ভাল ভবিষ্যৎ কথন।” (এ হাদীসটি ইমাম আহমাদ (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)মুসনাদে আহমাদে হযরত সাহল (রাঃ) ও হযরত আমির (রাঃ) সম্বলিত হাদীসটি, যা উপরে বর্ণিত হয়েছে, কিছুটা বিস্তারিতভাবেও বর্ণনা করা হয়েছে। কোন কোন রিওয়াইয়াতে এও বর্ণিত আছে যে, এ দুজন মহান ব্যক্তি গোসলের উদ্দেশ্যে গমন করেন। হযরত আমির (রাঃ) প্রথমে পানিতে অবতরণ করেন। তাঁর উন্মোচিত দেহের উপর হযরত সাহল (রাঃ)-এর নযর লেগে যায়। হযরত আমির (রাঃ) তৎক্ষণাৎ অজ্ঞানভাবে শব্দ করতে থাকেন। এ দেখে হযরত সাহল (রাঃ) তাকে তিনবার ডাক দেন, কিন্তু তার কোন সাড়া না পেয়ে রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ)-এর খিদমতে হাযির হন এবং তাঁর নিকট ঘটনাটি বর্ণনা করেন। রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) তখন স্বয়ং সেখানে গমন করেন এবং লুঙ্গী কিছুটা উঠিয়ে নিয়ে পানিতে নেমে পড়েন, এমন কি হযরত সাহল (রাঃ) তাঁর পদনালীর শুভ্রাংশ দেখতে পান। অতঃপর তিনি হযরত আমির (রাঃ)-এর বক্ষের উপর হাত মেরে দু'আ করেনঃ (আরবি)আল্লাহ! আপনি তার উষ্ণতা, শৈত্যতা ও কষ্ট দূর করে দিন!” এরপর হযরত আমির (রাঃ)-এর জ্ঞান ফিরে আসে এবং তিনি উঠে দাঁড়ান। অতঃপর রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেনঃ “যখন তোমাদের কেউ তার (মুসলমান) ভাই এর কোন কিছু দেখে চমৎকৃত হবে তখন যেন সে তার বরকতের জন্যে দু'আ করে। কেননা নযর লেগে যাওয়া সত্য।”হযরত জাবির ইবনে আবদিল্লাহ (রাঃ) তাঁর পিতা হতে বর্ণনা করেছেন যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “ফায়সালা ও তকদীরের পর আমার উম্মতের অধিকাংশ লোক (বদ) নযরের ফলে মারা যাবে।” (এ হাদীসটি হাফিয আবূ বকর আল বাযযার (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)হযরত জাবির ইবনে আবদিল্লাহ (রাঃ) হতেই বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “(বদ) নযর (এর ক্রিয়া) সত্য। এটা মানুষকে কবর পর্যন্ত পৌঁছিয়ে দেয়, আর উটকে পৌঁছিয়ে দেয় ডেগচী পর্যন্ত। আমার উম্মতের অধিকাংশের ধ্বংস এতেই রয়েছে। (এ হাদীসটি হাফিয আবূ আবদির রহমান বর্ণনা করেছেন। আর একটি সহীহ সনদের মাধ্যমেও এ রিওয়াইয়াতটি বর্ণিত আছে)মুসনাদে আহমাদে হযরত আবদুল্লাহ ইবনে আমর (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) বলেছেনঃ “একের রোগ অপরকে হয় না, ‘হাম’ এর কারণে ধ্বংস সাধিত হওয়াকে বিশ্বাস করা ঠিক নয়, আর হিংসাও কিছু নয় (হিংসা করে কারো কোন ক্ষতি করা যায় না এবং (বদ) নযর (এর ক্রিয়া) সত্য।”হযরত আলী (রাঃ) হতে বর্ণিত আছে যে, হযরত জিবরাঈল (আঃ) নবী (সঃ)-এর নিকট আগমন করেন এবং তাঁকে চিন্তিত দেখে এর কারণ জিজ্ঞেস করলে তিনি বলেনঃ “হাসান (রাঃ) ও হুসাইন (রাঃ)-কে বদ নযর লেগে গেছে।\" একথা শুনে হযরত জিবরাঈল (আঃ) বলেনঃ “এটা সত্য বটে। নযর সত্যিই লেগে থাকে। আপনি এ কালেমাগুলো পড়ে তাদের জন্যে আশ্রয় প্রার্থনা করেননি কেন?\" রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) উত্তরে বললেনঃ “ঐ কালেমাগুলো কি?” হযরত জিবরাঈল (আঃ) বললেন যে, কালেমাগুলো হলোঃ (আরবি)অর্থাৎ “হে আল্লাহ! হে বড় রাজত্বের মালিক! হে যবরদস্ত ইহসানকারী। হে বুযুর্গ চেহারার অধিকারী। হে পরিপূর্ণ কালেমার মালিক! হে প্রার্থনা কবূলকারী! আপনি হাসান (রাঃ) ও হুসাইন (রাঃ)-কে জ্বিনদের সমস্ত কুমন্ত্রণা হতে এবং মানুষের বদ নযর হতে আশ্রয় দান করুন।” তখন রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) এ কালেমাগুলো পাঠ করলেন। ফলে তৎক্ষণাৎ হযরত হাসান (রাঃ) ও হযরত হুসাইন (রাঃ) উঠে দাঁড়ালেন এবং তাঁর সামনে খেলা করতে শুরু করলেন। এ দেখে রাসূলুল্লাহ (সঃ) জনগণকে বললেনঃ “হে লোক সকল! এই কালেমাগুলোর মাধ্যমে তোমাদের জন্তুগুলো এবং স্ত্রী ও ছেলে মেয়েদের জন্যে আশ্রয় প্রার্থনা কর। জেনে রেখো যে, আশ্রয় প্রার্থনার জন্যে এর মত দু'আ আর নেই।” (এ হাদীসটি হাফিজ ইবনে আসাকির (রঃ) বর্ণনা করেছেন)এরপর আল্লাহ তা'আলা বলেনঃ হে নবী (সঃ)! কাফিররা যখন কুরআন শ্রবণ করে তখন তারা যেন তাদের তীক্ষ্ণ দৃষ্টি দ্বারা তোমাকে আছড়িয়ে ফেলে দিবে এবং তারা বলেঃ এতো এক পাগল! আল্লাহ তা'আলা তাদের এ কথার জবাবে বলেনঃ “কুরআন তো বিশ্বজগতের জন্যে উপদেশ।”</p>"

For verily, Allah will give you authority over them, and make the final victory for you and your followers in this life and the Hereafter.'</p><p>وَلاَ تَكُن كَصَـحِبِ الْحُوتِ</p><p>(and be not like the Companion of the Fish) meaning, Dhun-Nun, who was Yunus bin Matta, when he went off angry with his people. Various things happened to him, such as riding on a ship at sea, being swallowed by a (large) fish, the fish carrying him off into the ocean, being in the darkness and depth of the sea and hearing the sea's and its dwellers glorification of the Most High, the Most Able (Allah). For He (Allah) is the One Whose execution of divine decree cannot be resisted. After all of this, he (Yunus) called out from the layers of darkness,</p><p>أَن لاَّ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنتَ سُبْحَـنَكَ إِنِّى كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(\"That none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah), Glorified (and Exalted) are You! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers.\") (21:87) Then Allah said concerning him,</p><p>فَاسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ وَنَجَّيْنَـهُ مِنَ الْغَمِّ وَكَذلِكَ نُنجِـى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(So We answered his call, and delivered him from the distress. And thus We do deliver the believers.) (21:88) Allah also says,</p><p>فَلَوْلاَ أَنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ الْمُسَبِّحِينَ - لَلَبِثَ فِى بَطْنِهِ إِلَى يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ</p><p>(Had he not been of them who glorify Allah, he would have indeed remained inside its belly (the fish) till the Day when they are resurrected.) (37:143,144) So here (in this Surah), Allah says,</p><p>إِذْ نَادَى وَهُوَ مَكْظُومٌ</p><p>(when he cried out (to Us) while he was Makzum.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and As-Suddi, all said, \"while he was distressed.\" Then Allah goes on to say,</p><p>فَاجْتَبَـهُ رَبُّهُ فَجَعَلَهُ مِنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ</p><p>(Then his Lord chose him and made him of the righteous.) Imam Ahmad recorded from `Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا يَنْبَغِي لِأَحَدٍ أَنْ يَقُولَ: أَنَا خَيْرٌ مِنْ يُونُسَ بْنِ مَتَّى»</p><p>(It is not befitting for anyone to say that I am better than Yunus bin Matta.) Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith and it is in the Two Sahihs reported from Abu Hurayrah. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِن يَكَادُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَيُزْلِقُونَكَ بِأَبْصَـرِهِمْ</p><p>(And verily, those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others have said,</p><p>لَيُزْلِقُونَكَ</p><p>(would make you slip) \"In order to have some effect on you.\"</p><p>بِأَبْصَـرِهِمْ</p><p>(with their eyes) meaning, `they will affect you by looking at you with their eyes (i.e., the evil eye).' This means `they are jealous of you due to their hatred of you, and were it not for Allah's protection of you, defending you against them (then their evil eye would harm you).'</p><h2>The Effect of the Evil Eye is Real</h2><p>In this Ayah is a proof that the effect of the evil eye and its affliction by the command of Allah is real. Many Hadiths have been reported concerning this through numerous routes of transmission. The Hadith of Buraydah bin Al-Husayb Abu `Abdullah bin Majah recorded from Buraydah bin Al-Husayb that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا رُقْيَةَ إِلَّا مِنْ عَيْنٍ أَوْ حُمَة»</p><p>(There is no Ruqyah except to cure the evil eye and the sting.) This is how Ibn Majah recorded this Hadith. Imam Muslim also recorded this Hadith in his Sahih on the authority of Buraydah himself, but he did not attribute it to the Prophet . There is a story concerning this incident (as reported by Buraydah in Sahih Muslim), and At-Tirmidhi recorded the Hadith in this manner (like Muslim's version). This Hadith has also been recorded by Imam Al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi on the authority of `Imran bin Husayn, however, he did not attribute it to the Prophet . `Imran's wording is,</p><p>«لَا رُقْيَةَ إِلَّا مِنْ عَيْنٍ أَوْ حُمَة»</p><p>(There is no Ruqyah except to cure the evil eye and the sting.)\" Muslim recorded in his Sahih from Ibn `Abbas that the Prophet said,</p><p>«الْعَيْنُ حَقٌّ وَلَوْ كَانَ شَيْءٌ سَابَقَ الْقَدَرَ سَبَقَتِ الْعَيْنُ وَإِذَا اسْتُغْسِلْتُمْ فَاغْسِلُوا»</p><p>(The evil eye is real. If anything were to overtake the divine decree (and change it), then it would be the evil eye. And if you perform Ghusl (to remove the evil eye) then wash well.) Muslim was alone in recording this Hadith, as Al-Bukhari did not mention it. It is reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to invoke Allah's protection for Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn (his grandsons) by saying,</p><p>«أُعِيذُكُمَا بِكَلِمَاتِ اللهِ التَّامَّةِ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْطَانٍ وَهَامَّةٍ، وَمِنْ كُلِّ عَيْنٍ لَامَّة»</p><p>(I seek protection for you two by the perfect Words of Allah from every Shaytan, and dangerous creature, and from every eye that is evil.) Then he would say:</p><p>«هَكَذَا كَانَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ يُعَوِّذُ إِسْحَاقَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ عَلَيْهِمَا السَّلَام»</p><p>(Thus, did Ibrahim used to seek protection for Ishaq and Isma`il (his sons).)\" This Hadith was recorded by Al-Bukhari and the Sunan compilers.</p><h2>The Hadith of Abu Umamah As`ad bin Sahl bin Hunayf</h2><p>Ibn Majah recorded from Abu Umamah As`ad bin Sahl bin Hunayf that `Amir bin Rabi`ah passed by Sahl bin Hunayf while he was bathing and he said, \"I haven't seen the skin of a beautiful virgin girl nicer than this that I see today (i.e., commenting on how nice Sahl's skin was).\" So he did not leave before he (Sahl) fell down on the ground. So he was brought to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and it was said to him (the Prophet ) that Sahl had been afflicted by a seizure. The Prophet then said,</p><p>«مَنْ تَتَّهِمُونَ بِهِ؟»</p><p>(Who do you blame (or hold responsible) for this) The people replied, \"\"Amir bin Rabi`ah.\" Then the Prophet said,</p><p>«عَلَامَ يَقْتُلُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ؟ إِذَا رَأَى أَحَدُكُمْ مِنْ أَخِيهِ مَا يُعْجِبُهُ فَلْيَدْعُ لَهُ بِالْبَرَكَة»</p><p>(Would one of you knowingly kill his brother If one of you sees something of his brother that he likes, then let him supplicate for blessings for him.) Then the Prophet called for some water and he commanded `Amir to perform Wudu' with the water. So he washed his face, his hands up to his two elbows, his two knees, and the inside of his Izar. Then the Prophet commanded him to pour the water over Sahl. Sufyan said that Ma`mar related from Az-Zuhri that he said, \"The Prophet ordered him to turn the water pot over (empty its contents over) him (Sahl) from behind him.\" An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith through different routes from Abu Umamah with the wording, \"And he turned the pot over pouring its contents over him (Sahl) from behind him.\"</p><h2>The Hadith of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri</h2><p>Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to seek refuge from the evil eye of the Jinns and the evil eye of humans. Then when the Mu`awwidhatan were revealed, he used them (for seeking protection) and abandoned everything else. This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan.\"</p><h2>Another Hadith from Abu Sa`id Imam</h2><p>Ahmad recorded from Abu Sa`id that Jibril came to the Prophet and said, \"O Muhammad, are you suffering from any ailment\" The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَم»</p><p>(Yes).\" Then Jibril said,</p><p>«بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ يُؤْذِيكَ، وَمِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ وَعَيْنٍ تَشْنِيكَ، وَاللهُ يَشْفِيكَ، بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيك»</p><p>(\"In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing (Ruqyah), from everything that bothers you, from the evil of every soul and every evil eye that hates you, may Allah cure you, in the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing.\") This Hadith has been recorded by Muslim and the Sunan compilers except for Abu Dawud. Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Sa`id or Jabir bin `Abdullah that the Messenger of Allahﷺ  was bothered by some illness, and Jibril came to him and said,</p><p>«بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ يُؤْذِيكَ، مِنْ كُلِّ حَاسِدٍ وَعَيْنٍ، اللهُ يَشْفِيك»</p><p>(In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing (Ruqyah), from everything that bothers you, from every envious person and evil eye, may Allah cure you.)</p><h2>Another Hadith from Abu Sa`id</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Sa`id that Jibril came to the Prophet and said, \"O Muhammad, are you suffering from any ailment\" The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَم»</p><p>(Yes).\" Then Jibril said,</p><p>«بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ يُؤْذِيكَ، وَمِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ وَعَيْنٍ تَشْنِيكَ، وَاللهُ يَشْفِيكَ، بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيك»</p><p>(\"In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing (Ruqyah), from everything that bothers you, from the evil of every soul and every evil eye that hates you, may Allah cure you, in the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing.\") This Hadith has been recorded by Muslim and the Sunan compilers except for Abu Dawud. Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Sa`id or Jabir bin `Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was bothered by some illness, and Jibril came to him and said,</p><p>«بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ يُؤْذِيكَ، مِنْ كُلِّ حَاسِدٍ وَعَيْنٍ، اللهُ يَشْفِيك»</p><p>(In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing (Ruqyah), from everything that bothers you, from every envious person and evil eye, may Allah cure you.)</p><h2>The Hadith of Asma' bint `Umays</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded from `Ubayd bin Rifa`ah Az-Zuraqi that Asma' said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Verily, Bani Ja`far are afflicted with the evil eye; should I seek to have Ruqyah \" The Prophet replied,</p><p>«نَعَمْ فَلَوْ كَانَ شَيْءٌ يَسْبِقُ الْقَدَرَ لَسَبَقَتْهُ الْعَيْن»</p><p>(Yes, for if anything could overcome the divine decree, it would be the evil eye.) This Hadith has been recorded like this by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said concerning it, \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Hadith of `A'ishah</h2><p>Ibn Majah recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered her to have Ruqyah performed as a cure against the evil eye. This was reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. The Hadith of Sahl bin Hunayf Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Umamah bin Sahl bin Hunayf that his father informed him that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ went out on a journey in the direction of Makkah and they (the Companions) accompanied him until they came to the valley of Kharrar from Al-Juhfah. They stopped there and Sahl took a bath. He (Sahl) was a white man, with a handsome body and nice skin. So the brother of Bani `Adi bin Ka`b, `Amir bin Rabi`ah looked at Sahl while he bathed and he said, \"I haven't seen the skin of a beautiful virgin girl nicer than this that I see today.\" Then Sahl suddenly had a seizure and fell to the ground. So he (Sahl) was brought to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and it was said to him, \"O Messenger of Allah! Can you do anything for Sahl By Allah, he has not lifted his head nor has he regained consciousness.\" The Prophet then said,</p><p>«هَلْ تَتَّهِمُونَ فِيهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ؟»</p><p>(Do you all blame (or hold responsible) anyone for what has happened to him) They said, \"`Amir bin Rabi`ah looked at him.\" So the Prophet called `Amir and he was very angry with him. He said,</p><p>«عَلَامَ يَقْتُلُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ، هَلَّا إِذَا رَأَيْتَ مَا يُعْجِبُكَ بَرَّكْتَ؟»</p><p>(Would one of you knowingly kill his brother Why don't you ask Allah to bless your brother when you see something (of him) that you like) Then the Prophet said,</p><p>«اغْتَسِلْ لَه»</p><p>(Bathe for him.) So he (`Amir) washed his face, his hands, his elbows, his knees, his feet and the inside of his Izar (waist wrapper) in a drinking vessel. Then that water was poured over him (Sahl). A man poured it over Sahl's head and his back from behind him, then the container was turned upside down and emptied behind him. This was done, and afterwards Sahl recovered and left with the people having nothing wrong with him.\"</p><h2>The Hadith of `Amir bin Rabi`ah</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad that `Ubaydullah bin `Amir said, \"`Amir bin Rabi`ah and Sahl bin Hanayf went off together intending to bathe. So they went about their business using coverings (to cover their nakedness). So `Amir removed a cloak of wool that he (Sahl) was using to conceal himself. He (`Amir) said, `I looked at him and my eye fell upon him while he was pouring water on himself bathing. Then I heard a loud splash in the water coming from where he was. So I went to him, and I called him three times, but he did not answer me. So I went to the Prophet and informed him. Then, the Prophet came walking, and he was wading in the water. I can still picture the whiteness of his shins. When he came to Sahl (who was unconscious), he hit him on his chest with his hand and said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اصْرِفْ عَنْهُ حَرَّهَا وَبَرْدَهَا وَوَصَبَهَا»</p><p>(O Allah! Remove from him its heat, its cold and its pain.) He (Sahl) then stood up, and Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا رَأَى أَحَدُكُمْ مِنْ أَخِيهِ، أَوْ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ، أَوْ مِنْ مَالِهِ مَا يُعْجِبُهُ، فَلْيُبَرِّكْ فَإِنَّ الْعَيْنَ حَق»</p><p>(If one of you sees in his brother, or himself, or his wealth that which pleases him, then he should ask Allah to bless it, for verily, the evil eye is real.)</p><h2>The Accusation of the Disbelievers and the Reply to Them</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>وَيَقُولُونَ إِنَّهُ لَمَجْنُونٌ</p><p>(and they say: \"Verily, he is a madman!\") meaning, they cut at him with their eyes and attack him with their tongues saying, \"Verily, he is a madman.\" They say this because he came with the Qur'an. Allah then says,</p><p>وَمَا هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ لِّلْعَالَمِينَ</p><p>(But it is nothing else but a Reminder to all the creatures (`Alamin).) This is the end of the explanation (Tafsir) of Surah Nun (or Al-Qalam), and all praise and blessing belong to Allah.</p>"

            "text": "<p>1-This is the literal translation of the Qur'anic phrase used here. The exegetes have explained it in two different ways. Some of them are of the view that, according to the Arabic usage, 'exposure of the shin' is an idiomatic expression for a severe state of distress. When a person is confronted with such a distress, he normally lays his shins bare. Therefore, exposure of the shin has been taken as indicative of such a state. Given this interpretation, the verse means that on the day when the disbelievers will face the severe distress, they will be called upon to prostrate themselves, but they will not be able to do so, because their backs will be made flat, with no elasticity to bow down. Some other commentators, however, take the phrase in its literal sense. They say that the 'Shin' referred to here is the Shin of Allah Ta'ala, which is one of His attributes, the exact nature of which is neither known to anybody, nor discoverable in this world. (But obviously, it is not like the shins of human beings). According to this interpretation, the verse means that, at some stage on the Day of Judgment, Allah Ta'ala will expose this attribute of His which is called 'Shin', and they will be called upon to prostrate before it. This interpretation is supported by an authentic hadith reported by Bukhari and Muslim.</p><p>2-It refers to Sayyidna Yunus (علیہ السلام) who was devoured by a fish after he left his nation. Full description of the event has been given in Surah Yunus. (Muhammad Taqi Usmani)</p><p>3-According to the explanation given to this verse by Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanawi (رح) ، 'Favour from His Lord' means the acceptance of his repentance, and 'wilderness' refers to the place where he was thrown by the fish. If this verse is read in juxtaposition with Verses 143, 144 of Surah As-Saffat, the sense appears to be that if Yunus had not offered tasbih and taubah, he would have remained in the belly of the fish for good, and if he had repented, but was not favoured by Allah with the acceptance of his taubah, he would have been cast by the fish into the wilderness, due to his repentance, but in a reproachable state. However, since Allah favoured him with accepting his taubah, he was no more reproachable. Some other scholars, however, suggest that 'wilderness' in this verse refers to the plain of Hashr, and the verse means that if Allah had not accepted his taubah, he would have been cast into the plain of Hashr in a reproachable state.</p><p>4-It means that they glare at you with such a hatred and anger as if they were to make you slip from your standpoint due to their aversion.</p>"

The verb 'layuzliqunaka' is derived from izlaq which means 'to trip up or to cause someone to fall or make a mistake' [ Raghib ]. The verse says to the Holy Prophet that disbelievers cast angry looks at him that they might frighten him into giving up his mission or intimidate him into yielding to their pressure tactics. When they listen to Divine words, they call him a madman. But far from it, his teaching contains the quintessence of wisdom - the Qur'an puts it thus:</p><p>وَمَا هُوَ إِلَّا ذِكْرٌ‌ لِّلْعَالَمِينَ (And it is nothing else but a Reminder for all the worlds.... 68:52). Divine words are a Reminder and an admonition for the entire universe. The Reminder will lift the people from the lowest depths of degradation to the highest summits of greatness and glory. It would also cleanse them and free them from moral blemishes and raise their spiritual stature. Is it possible for an insane person to receive and deliver such a Sublime Divine Message? Can a Prophet of such a high caliber be called a madman? The earlier verses of this Surah rebutted the charge of insanity against the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Towards the end of the Surah, the same charge of lunacy is rebutted again in a different style.</p><p>Imam Baghawi (رح) and some other commentators have reported another event as background of this verse. The evil eye is a reality which causes loss, illness and destruction. Authentic Traditions report that it is a reality. The Arabs also believed that an evil eye is a reality. There was a person famous in Arabia to cast an evil eye on camels or animals to cause instant death or destruction. The pagans of Arabia were enemies of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and in every possible way they were after persecuting him and killing him. They left no stone unturned in harming him. They even contemplated afflicting him with an evil eye. They therefore decided to secure the services of the particular person who could effectively cast an evil eye. He was instructed to cast the evil eye on the Messenger of Allah ﷺ so that he would become ill. He exerted himself to the utmost, but to no avail. Allah protected him and he was unaffected. The verses were revealed in connection with this incident.</p><p>Special Note</p><p>Sayyidna Hasan Basri (رح) reports that if anyone is affected by the evil eye, these verses (51  52) may be recited and blown on the person: the ill effect will be dispelled.</p><p>Alhamdulillah</p><p>The Commentary on</p><p>Surah Al-Qalam</p><p>Ends here</p>"
